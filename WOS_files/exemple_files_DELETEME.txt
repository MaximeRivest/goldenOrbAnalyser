In this study, we related invertebrate species composition, their dominance structure and fish biological characteristics to the feeding selectivity and overlap of the native flounder, perch and the invasive round goby in Muuga Bay, the Baltic Sea. Species composition and proportion of benthic invertebrates in the diet of fishes differed from what was available in the field. Except for the round goby, the studied fishes preferred small and mobile invertebrates over large bivalves. However, diet of the studied species, namely the round goby and flounder overlapped. Besides, perch preyed on young stages of the round goby indicating that the introduction of round goby may negatively affect flounder but positively perch.

Recent Bayesian models (MixSIR, SIAR) allow users to incorporate variability in discrimination factors (Delta(13)C or Delta(15)N), or the amount of change in either delta(13)C or delta(15)N between prey and consumer, but to date there has been no systematic assessment of the effect of variation in Delta(13)C or Delta(15)N on model outputs. We used whole blood from Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) and muscle from their common prey items (fish and euphausiids) to build a series of mixing models in SIAR (stable isotope analysis in R) using various discrimination factors from the published literature for marine birds. The estimated proportion of each diet component was affected significantly by Delta(13)C or Delta(15)N. We also use recently published stable-isotope data on the reliance of critically endangered Balearic Shearwaters (Puffinus mauretanicus) on fisheries discards to show that discrimination factor choice can have profound implications for conservation and management actions. It is therefore crucial for researchers wishing to use mixing models to have an accurate estimate of Delta(13)C and Delta(15)N, because quantitative diet estimates can help to direct future research or prioritize conservation and management actions.

Importance of Carolina Bays to the Avifauna of Pinelands in the Southeastern United States	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST			English	Article							ISOLATED WETLANDS; SOUTH-CAROLINA; COASTAL-PLAIN; PIEDMONT; BIRDS	Past anthropogenic activity has led to the destruction or alteration of Carolina bay wetlands throughout the southeastern United States. Presently, urban development, combined with a 2001 ruling by the US Supreme Court relaxing protection of isolated wetlands, poses an increasing threat to these and other isolated wetland systems; however, little information exists on the importance of these wetland systems to birds. We compared breeding and wintering bird communities of upland pine (Pinus spp.) forests with and without Carolina bays. Estimated species richness was greater in pine forests with Carolina bays than without during the winter (31.7 +/- 1.3 [mean +/- SE] vs. 26.9 +/- 1.2; P = 0.027), but not in the breeding season (27.9 +/- 2.2 vs. 26.3 +/- 2.2; P = 0.644). Total relative abundance did not differ between pine forests with Carolina bays and those without in either the breeding (148.0 +/- 16.0 vs. 129.4 +/- 10.4 birds/40 ha; P = 0.675) or winter (253.0 +/- 36.4 vs. 148.8 +/- 15.1 birds/40 ha; P = 0.100) seasons. However, 23 species, 43% of which were wetland-dependent, were observed only in pine forests with bays during the breeding season, and 20 species, 30% of which were wetland-dependent, were observed only in such sites during winter. In contrast, only 6 and 1 species were observed only in pine forests without bays during the breeding and winter seasons, respectively, indicating that few species were negatively affected by the presence of bays. Thus, Carolina bays appear to enrich the avifauna of pine forests in the southeastern United States.

Monitoring the abundance and spatial structure of invasive alien plant populations is important for designing and measuring the efficacy of long-term management strategies. However, methods for monitoring over large areas with minimum sampling effort, but with sufficient accuracy, are lacking. Although sophisticated sampling techniques are available for increasing sampling efficiency, they are often difficult to implement for large-scale monitoring, thus necessitating a robust yet practical method. 2. We explored this problem over a large area (c.20 000 km2), using ad hoc presence-absence records routinely collected over 4 years in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. Using a Bayesian method designed to solve the pseudo-absence (or false-negative) dilemma, we estimated the abundance and spatial structure of all invasive alien plants in KNP. Five sampling schemes, with different spatially weighted sampling efforts, were assessed and the optimal sampling effort estimated. 3. Although most taxa have very few records (50% of the species have only one record), the more abundant species showed a log-normal species-abundance distribution, with the 29 most abundant taxa being represented by an estimated total of 2 center dot 22 million individuals, with most exhibiting positive spatial autocorrelation. 4. Estimations from all sampling schemes approached the real situation with increasing sampling effort. An equal-weighted (uniform) sampling scheme performed best for abundance estimation (optimal efforts of 68 records per km2), but showed no advantage in detecting spatial autocorrelation (247 records per km2 required). With increasing sampling effort, the accuracy of abundance estimation followed an exponential form, whereas the accuracy of distribution estimation showed diverse forms. Overall, a power law relationship between taxon density (as well as the spatial autocorrelation) and the optimal sampling effort was determined. 5.Synthesis and applications. The use of Bayesian methods to estimate optimal sampling effort indicates that for large-scale monitoring, reliable and accurate schemes are feasible. These methods can be used to determine optimal schemes in areas of different sizes and situations. In a large area like KNP, the uniform equal-weighted sampling scheme performs optimally for monitoring abundance and distribution of invasive alien plants, and is recommended as a protocol for large-scale monitoring in other protected areas as well.

J	MacIvor, JS; Lundholm, J				MacIvor, J. Scott; Lundholm, Jeremy			Insect species composition and diversity on intensive green roofs and adjacent level-ground habitats	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article							BIODIVERSITY	While it is expected that green roofs support a wider variety of insects compared with conventional roof surfaces, few studies have quantified insect diversity on green roofs. Even fewer have attempted to determine whether green roofs can support insect communities comparable to level-ground urban habitats. In this study, insect richness, abundance and diversity indices were compared between five pairs of intensive green roofs and adjacent ground-level habitat patches in downtown Halifax, Nova Scotia. Pitfall traps were set at each site, collected bi-weekly between May-October 2009 and captured insects were identified to morphospecies (except where taxonomic expertise was available). No significant differences in richness, abundance or any of the indices (S, H', E(var)) were detected in analysis, which included plant species richness, site area and sampling effort as covariables. However, richness and abundance tended to be greater at ground level for all orders (except Heteroptera), and diversity appeared to increase away from the downtown core. Insect composition differed slightly between green roof and ground-level sites; only 17 species were collected from a single site type in numbers greater than five specimens. Nevertheless, a wide variety of insects, including many uncommon species were collected from green roofs, supporting the idea that these habitats can contribute to sustaining biodiversity in cities.

J	Turvey, ST; Blackburn, TM				Turvey, Samuel T.; Blackburn, Tim M.			Determinants of species abundance in the Quaternary vertebrate fossil record	PALEOBIOLOGY			English	Article							COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; RELATIVE ABUNDANCE; CANONICAL DISTRIBUTION; HUMAN IMPACTS; ASSEMBLAGES; PRESERVATION; POPULATIONS; EXTINCTIONS; COMMONNESS; PATTERNS	Species abundance data are of vital importance in paleontology, but fossil accumulations invariably represent a biased subset of original source communities. Efforts to quantify taphonomic biases are typically prevented by a lack of independent data on the ecological composition of prehistoric faunas. However, analysis of the continental Holocene record can provide a rare opportunity for independent calibration of fossil abundance patterns. We analyzed a comprehensive data set available for the Holocene avifauna of Sweden to investigate the relationship between species abundance in the recent fossil and zooarchaeological records and in prehistoric source communities, and to characterize the importance of different ecological factors in determining terrestrial vertebrate fossil abundances. The number of assemblages in which species occurred was compared with modern-day species abundance, annual residence, body mass, and ecological realm. Modern-day abundance is only one of several significant predictors of fossil abundance; the strongest predictor is body mass, and Holocene species abundance can be interpreted as a measure of species abundance in source communities for a given size class only. Our study represents one of the only direct attempts to quantify species abundance biases between fossil faunas and source communities, and has general applicability for a wide range of terrestrial vertebrate faunas.

Simulating a natural fire regime on an Atlantic coast barrier island complex in Florida, USA	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Florida; Fire regime modeling; HFire	NINO-SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; EAST-CENTRAL FLORIDA; HISTORIC LANDCOVER; LANDSCAPE CHANGE; WILDFIRE; SCRUB; POPULATION; VEGETATION; DYNAMICS	The HFire fire regime model was used to simulate the natural fire regime (prior to European settlement) on Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, Canaveral National Seashore, and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. Model simulations were run for 500 years and the model was parameterized using information generated from previously published empirical studies on these properties (e.g., lightning fire ignition frequencies and ignition seasonality). A mosaic pattern of frequent small fires dominated this fire regime with rare but extremely large fires occurring during dry La Nina periods. This simulated fire size distribution very closely matched the previously published fire size distribution for lightning ignitions on these properties. A sensitivity analysis was performed to establish which parameters were most influential and the range of variation surrounding empirically parameterized model output. Dead fuel moisture and wind speed had the largest influence on model outcome. A wide range of variance was observed surrounding the composite simulation with the least being 6% in total burn frequency and the greatest being 49% in total area burned. Because simulation modeling is the best option for fire regime reconstruction in many rapidly growing shrub dominated systems, these results will be of interest to scientists and fire managers for delineating the natural fire regime on these properties, the southeastern United States and other fire adapted shrub systems worldwide.

J	Gilligan, LA; Muir, PS				Gilligan, Laurie A.; Muir, Patricia S.			Stand Structures of Oregon White Oak Woodlands, Regeneration, and Their Relationships to the Environment in Southwestern Oregon	NORTHWEST SCIENCE			English	Article							QUERCUS-GARRYANA; PUGET TROUGH; DOUGLAS-FIR; FORT-LEWIS; WASHINGTON; COMMUNITIES; CALIFORNIA; SEEDLINGS; PRAIRIES; RELEASE	Although Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana) woodlands are a characteristic landscape component in southwestern Oregon, little is known about their current or historical stand structures. Meanwhile, fuel reduction thinning treatments that change stand structures in non-coniferous communities are ongoing and widespread on public lands in this region; some of these treatments also have restoration objectives. Managers need baseline information on which to base prescriptions that have a restoration focus. We inventoried 40 Oregon white oak dominated woodlands across two study areas in southwestern Oregon, and describe here their stand characteristics and age structures. We assessed whether these varied systematically with site conditions or recorded fire history. Stands included various proportions of single-and multiple-stemmed trees and a range of tree densities and diameter-and age-class distributions. Variables that may indicate site moisture status were weakly associated with multivariate gradients in stand structure. Peak establishment of living Oregon white oaks generally occurred during 1850-1890, sometimes occurred in the early 1900s, and recruitment rates were low post-fire suppression (similar to 1956). Recruitment of sapling-sized oak trees (<10 cm diameter at breast height, >= 1.3 m tall) was generally low and their ages ranged from 5 to 164 yr; they were not necessarily recent recruits. The observed wide range of variability in stand characteristics likely reflects the diversity of mechanisms that has shaped them, and suggests that a uniform thinning approach is unlikely to foster this natural range of variability.

Ranked species occupancy curves reveal common patterns among diverse metacommunities	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Distribution; disturbance; macroecology; metacommunity; occupancy; presence; regional community; succession	ABUNDANCE DISTRIBUTIONS; FREQUENCY-DISTRIBUTIONS; REGIONAL-DISTRIBUTION; ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; SELF-SIMILARITY; RAIN-FORESTS; ECOLOGY; HYPOTHESIS; DISPERSAL	Aim Community ecologists often compare assemblages. Alternatively, one may compare species distributions among assemblages for macroecological comparisons of species niche traits and dispersal abilities, which are consistent with metacommunity theory and a regional community concept. The aim of this meta-analysis is to use regressions of ranked species occupancy curves (RSOCs) among diverse metacommunities and to consider the common patterns observed. Location Diverse data sets from four continents are analysed. Methods Six regression models were translated from traditional occupancy frequency distributions (OFDs) and are distributed among four equation families. Each regression model was fitted to each of 24 data sets and compared using the Akaike information criterion. The analysed data sets encompass a wide range of spatial scales (5 cm-50 km grain, 2-7000 km extent), study scales (11-590 species, 6-5114 sites) and taxa. Observed RSOC regressions were tested for the differences in scale and taxa. Results Three RSOC models within two equation families (exponential and sigmoidal) are required to describe the very different data sets. This result is generally consistent with OFD research, but unlike OFD-based expectations the simple RSOC patterns are not related to spatial scale or other factors. Species occupancy in diverse metacommunities is efficiently summarized with RSOCs, and multi-model inference reliably distinguishes among alternative RSOCs. Main conclusions RSOCs are simple to generate and analyse and clearly identified surprisingly similar patterns among very different metacommunities. Species-specific hypotheses (e.g. niche-based factors and dispersal abilities) that depend on spatial scale may not translate to diverse metacommunities that sample regional communities. A novel set of three metacommunity succession and disturbance hypotheses potentially explain RSOC patterns and should be tested in subsequent research. RSOCs are an operational approach to the regional community concept and should be useful in macroecology and metacommunity ecology.

The impact of urbanization on taxonomic and functional similarity among bird communities	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Australia; beta-diversity; birds; community similarity; distance-decay effect; functional similarity; homogenization; species turnover; taxonomic similarity; urbanization	MEASURING BETA-DIVERSITY; PRESENCE-ABSENCE DATA; BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION; DISTANCE-DECAY; ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES; BIOGEOGRAPHY; ASSEMBLAGES; LANDSCAPE; TURNOVER; PATTERNS	Aim To assess spatial relationships between avian community similarity and level of urbanization. We tested the following hypotheses for taxonomic similarity: Hypothesis A - the decline in taxonomic similarity with distance is stronger for the least urbanized locations compared to the most urbanized locations; Hypothesis B - the converse of Hypothesis A; and Hypothesis C - the decline in taxonomic similarity with distance is stronger for the most and least urbanized locations compared to locations with intermediate levels of urbanization. We also determined if increasing urbanization led to increased functional similarity within bird communities. Location South-eastern Australia. Methods Bird species occurrence and density were sampled across 18 towns and 72 neighbourhoods occupying a spatial gradient of up to 882 km. We calculated pairwise values in taxonomic similarity among each town and neighbourhood using the S circle divide renson coefficient and a similarity measure that accounts for differences in species richness among locations. These values were plotted against pairwise distances among towns and neighbourhoods using linear regression to measure similarity-distance relationships. Neighbourhoods were categorized into four levels of urban development based on dwelling density, urban intensity, vegetation cover, or the density of native, nectar-rich plants. Variation in bird species density across neighbourhoods and frequency of occurrence across broad habitat types (habitat specialization) was used to assess functional similarity of bird communities in each neighbourhood. Results Among the 18 towns, the decline in taxonomic similarity with distance was weak and significantly less than among regional bird communities that occurred within a 1 degrees grid square around each town. Among the 72 neighbourhoods, similarity-distance relationships differed substantially depending on the level of urban development. Generally, the strongest decline in similarity with distance was for neighbourhoods with the highest and lowest dwelling density, urban intensity and vegetation cover, supporting Hypothesis C. The functional similarity of bird communities increased significantly with dwelling density, and decreased significantly with an increasing density of nectar plants. Main conclusions At the town level, urbanization appears to homogenize regional bird communities. Among neighbourhoods, similarity-distance relationships are substantially influenced by the level of urban development, and increasing urbanization leads to greater functional similarity within bird communities.

J	Mouchet, MA; Mouillot, D				Mouchet, Maud A.; Mouillot, David			Decomposing phylogenetic entropy into alpha, beta and gamma components	BIOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						branch; phylobetadiversity; phylogenetic diversity; scale; tree shape	DIVERSITY; EVOLUTIONARY; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITIES; PATTERNS; DISTINCTIVENESS; STATISTICS	Measuring the phylogenetic diversity of communities has become a key issue for biogeography and conservation. However, most diversity indices that rely on interspecies phylogenetic distances may increase with species loss and thus violate the principle of weak monotonicity. Moreover, most published phylogenetic diversity indices ignore the abundance distribution along phylogenetic trees, even though lineage abundances are crucial components of biodiversity. The recently introduced concept of phylogenetic entropy overcomes these limitations, but has not been decomposed across scales, i.e. into alpha, beta and gamma components. A full understanding of mechanisms sustaining biological diversity within and between communities needs such decomposition. Here, we propose an additive decomposition framework for estimating alpha, beta and gamma components of phylogenetic entropy. Based on simulated trees, we demonstrate its robustness to phylogenetic tree shape and species richness. Our decomposition fulfils the requirements of both independence between components and weak monotonicity. Finally, our decomposition can also be adapted to the partitioning of functional diversity across different scales with the same desirable properties.

Identifying Habitat Linkages to Maintain Connectivity for Corridor Dwellers in a Fragmented Landscape	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Coachella Valley; conservation; corridor dwellers; linkage; Mahalanobis D-2; niche model; Palm Springs pocket mouse; Perognathus longimembris bangsii; suitable niche space	PEROGNATHUS-LONGIMEMBRIS; SMALL MAMMALS; BURROWING OWLS; CONSERVATION; MODEL; MOVEMENTS; POPULATION; CHIPMUNKS; DYNAMICS; ROADS	Anthropogenic habitat fragmentation typically precedes conservation planning; maintaining remaining linkages among core habitat areas can thus become a key conservation objective. Identifying linkages for dispersal and ensuring those linkages have long-term protection and management are challenging tasks for wildlife managers. These tasks can be especially daunting for smaller species with low mobility, termed corridor dwellers, which must maintain sustainable populations within corridors. Between May 2007 and June 2009, we collected occurrence locations for a corridor dweller, the Palm Springs pocket mouse (Perognathus longimembris bangsii), from museums, previous research, and our own field sampling. We used those data to model their suitable niche space and then identify suitable linkages between proposed conservation areas. We used a partitioned Mahalanobis D-2 statistic to create a spatially explicit niche model describing the distribution of a suitable niche space, and we validated the model statistically, with live trapping and with burrowing owl (Athene cunnicularia) diets. Our model identified soil characteristics, topographic ruggedness, and vegetation as variables delimiting Palm Springs pocket mouse habitat; sand content of the soils was an especially important characteristic. Our historic distribution model identified 120,000-90,000 ha as historically potential Palm Springs pocketmouse habitat; roughly 39% of that has been lost to more recent development. Most of the remaining suitable habitat occurred in the northwestern portion of the valley. We modeled habitat within core reserves as well as within proposed linkages between those reserves as having high similarity to known occupied habitats. Live trapping in areas with high (>= 0.95) Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) values resulted in captures at 66% of those locations and, along with burrowing owl diets, refined a qualitative model as to what constituted a suitable Palm Springs pocket mouse corridor. While most corridor analyses have focused on mobile species which may traverse corridors in hours, days, or weeks, linkages for corridor dwellers must include habitat for sustaining multi-generational populations. This requires evaluating whether continuous suitable habitat exists within proposed corridors. Our research demonstrates how niche modeling can provide a landscape-scale view of the distribution of suitable habitat to evaluate conservation objectives for connectivity.

Biome transitions as centres of diversity: habitat heterogeneity and diversity patterns of West African bat assemblages across spatial scales	ECOGRAPHY			English	Review							BIRD SPECIES-DIVERSITY; BETA-DIVERSITY; GAMMA-DIVERSITY; GLOBAL PATTERNS; IVORY-COAST; RAIN-FOREST; LATITUDINAL GRADIENTS; ECHOLOCATION CALLS; INSECTIVOROUS BATS; REGIONAL PROCESSES	It is widely accepted that species diversity is contingent upon the spatial scale used to analyze patterns and processes. Recent studies using coarse sampling grains over large extents have contributed much to our understanding of factors driving global diversity patterns. This advance is largely unmatched on the level of local to landscape scales despite being critical for our understanding of functional relationships across spatial scales. In our study on West African bat assemblages we employed a spatially explicit and nested design covering local to regional scales. Specifically, we analyzed diversity patterns in two contrasting, largely undisturbed landscapes, comprising a rainforest area and a forest-savanna mosaic in Ivory Coast, West Africa. We employed additive partitioning, rarefaction, and species richness estimation to show that bat diversity increased significantly with habitat heterogeneity on the landscape scale through the effects of beta diversity. Within the extent of our study areas, habitat type rather than geographic distance explained assemblage composition across spatial scales. Null models showed structure of functional groups to be partly filtered on local scales through the effects of vegetation density while on the landscape scale both assemblages represented random draws from regional species pools. We present a mixture model that combines the effects of habitat heterogeneity and complexity on species richness along a biome transect, predicting a unimodal rather than a monotonic relationship with environmental variables related to water. The bat assemblages of our study by far exceed previous figures of species richness in Africa, and refute the notion of low species richness of Afrotropical bat assemblages, which appears to be based largely on sampling biases. Biome transitions should receive increased attention in conservation strategies aiming at the maintenance of ecological and evolutionary processes.	[Fahr, Jakob; Kalko, Elisabeth K.

Resource Partitioning Between Sympatric Columbian White-Tailed and Black-Tailed Deer in Western Oregon	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						black-tailed deer; Columbian white-tailed deer; diets; habitat use; resource partitioning; spatial distributions; western Oregon	EVALUATING GRAZING STRATEGIES; MULE DEER; NATIONAL-PARK; HABITAT USE; HOME-RANGE; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; NICHE SEPARATION; CATTLE DEER; COMPETITION; OVERLAP	We studied resource partitioning between sympatric populations of Columbian white-tailed (CWTD; Odocoileus virginianus leucurus) and black-tailed (BWTD) deer (O. odocoileus hemionus columbianus) in western Oregon to understand potential mechanisms of coexistence. We used horseback transects to describe spatial distributions, population overlap, and habitat use for both species, and we studied diets with microhistological analysis of fecal samples. Distribution patterns indicated that white-tailed and black-tailed deer maintained spatial separation during most seasons with spatial overlap ranging from 5%-40% seasonally. Coefficients of species association were negative, suggesting a pattern of mutual avoidance. White-tailed deer were more concentrated in the southern portions of the study area, which was characterized by lower elevations, more gradual slopes, and close proximity to streams. Black-tailed deer were more wide ranging and tended to occur in the northern portions of the study area, which had higher elevations and greater topographical variation. Habitat use of different vegetative assemblages was similar between white-tailed and black-tailed deer with overlap ranging from 89%-96% seasonally. White-tailed deer used nearly all habitats available on the study area except those associated with conifers. White-tailed deer used oak-hardwood savanna shrub, open grassland, oak-hardwood savanna, and riparian habitats the most. Black-tailed deer exhibited high use for open grassland and oak-hardwood savanna shrub habitats and lower use of all others. The 2 subspecies also exhibited strong seasonal similarities in diets with overlap ranging from 89% to 95%. White-tailed deer diets were dominated by forbs, shrubs, grasses, and other food sources (e. g., nuts and lichens). Columbian black-tailed deer diets were dominated mostly by forbs and other food sources. Seasonal diet diversity followed similar patterns for both species with the most diverse diets occurring in fall and the least diverse diets in spring. High overlap in habitat use and diets resulted in high trophic overlap (81-85%) between white-tailed and black-tailed deer; however, the low spatial overlap reduced the potential for exploitative competition but may have been indicative of inference competition between the species. Diverse habitat and forage opportunities were available on the study area due to heterogeneous landscape characteristics, which allowed ecological separation between white-tailed and black-tailed deer despite similarities in diets and habitat use. We make several recommendations for management of CWTD, a previously threatened species, based on the results of our study. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.

Due to their structural simplicity and their low levels of human impacts, extreme species-poor ecosystems may provide new insights into B-EF relationships in natural systems. We address this issue using shredder invertebrate communities and organic matter decomposition rates in 24 high-altitude (3200-3900 m) Neotropical streams as a study model. We first assessed the effects of stream characteristics and shredder diversity and abundance on organic matter decomposition rates in coarse-and fine-mesh bags. We found the interaction term shredder richness x shredder abundance had the most significant impact on decomposition rates in the field, although water discharge may also play a role locally. We also examined the relative contribution of the three most abundant shredders on decomposition rates by manipulating shredder richness and community composition in a field experiment. Transgressive overyielding was detected among the three shredder species, indicating complementary resource use and/or facilitation. By integrating survey and experimental data in surface response analyses we found that observed B-EF patterns fit those predicted by a linear model that described litter decomposition rates as a function of increasing shredder richness and the relative abundance of the most efficient shredders. Finally, the validity of our approach was tested in a broader context by using two independent but comparable data sets from 49 French and Swedish streams showing more complex shredder community structure. Results revealed that richness and identity effects on decomposition rates were lost with increasing shredder community complexity. Our approach of combining experimental and empirical data with modeling in species-poor ecosystems may serve as an impetus for new B-EF studies. If theory can explain B-EF in low-diversity ecosystems, it may also have credibility in more complex ones.

Density compensation, species composition, and richness of ants on a neotropical elevational gradient	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						Barva transect; biotic attrition; climate change; Costa Rica; density compensation; elevational gradient; Formicidae; Hymenoptera; range shifts; species density; species richness		The distribution of species on elevational gradients challenges our understanding of ecological processes, particularly in the context of biotic responses to climate change. We report here the distribution of leaf-litter ants on the Barva Transect, a continuous gradient of wet forest on Costa Rica's Atlantic slope. Seven sites were sampled, distributed from 50 to 2000 m. Worker density and microsite occupancy were high and relatively constant from 50 m to 1500 m and then abruptly dropped to near zero at 2000 m. Species density at the 1 m(2) scale was high and constant to 1070 m and then declined at higher elevations. Species richness of assemblages at the 1 km(2) scale was constant or rose slightly from 50 m to 500 m and then steeply declined. Because assemblage richness and species density declined more rapidly than worker density, density compensation with elevation is suggested and supported by a measure of mean population density. Statistically, temperature was the best predictor of both species richness and worker density. Relative humidity, soil nutrients, elevation-specific regional area, and the mid-domain effect were poor predictors of richness. Sites from 50 m to 500 m were similar in species composition. In contrast, assemblages at 1070 m, 1500 m, and 2000 m were highly differentiated. Thus elevational ranges were narrow for species at mid to upper elevations and broad for those at the lowest elevations. Density compensation at higher elevation suggests that if temperature or productivity are influencing the decline in diversity it must be indirectly through speciation and extinction processes, rather than by greater numbers of individuals. The broad ranges of lowland species may be a response to as yet unmeasured environmental factors (e.g., NPP) or to climate changes associated with the current interglacial period. Interglacial warming may have driven species to higher elevations, but the lack of competitors at the lower range margins may have allowed the lowest-elevation species to move upslope without a concomitant contraction of the lower range boundary. Global warming threatens a loss of narrowly-distributed montane species, but lowland biotic attrition may be ameliorated by range expansion among lowland species.

Spatial patterns and local diversity in soil oribatid mites (Acari: Oribatida) in three pine plantation forests	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Oribatida; Community structure; Similarity indices; Spatial autocorrelation; Distance decay; Distribution of abundances	TROPHIC NICHE DIFFERENTIATION; COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; GEOMETRIC SERIES; RIPARIAN WETLAND; DISTANCE DECAY; RAIN-FOREST; FIELD; DISTRIBUTIONS; BIODIVERSITY; BIOGEOGRAPHY	The study investigates diversity patterns in communities of soil oribatid mites (Acari: Oribatida) in three pine plantation forests in New Zealand. The distribution patterns at the metacommunity level were analyzed as the decay in community similarity as a function of intersample distance. The local diversity was analysed at the soil core level. Oribatida communities were characterized by high local diversity coupled with high degree of dominance in local distribution of abundances, and by spatially structured metacommunities, with high species turnover and significant distance decay in species presence/absence at all sampled distances. In all three sites community assemblages were spatially autocorrelated. In two sites the spatial dependence was present at all sampled distances. In the third site spatial autocorrelation in community structure existed at separation distances below approx. 40 m. The observed patterns appear to be consistent with ecological drift and stochastic model of community assembly under assumption of low dispersal, although there is some indication that spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality contributes to the species distribution. The results suggest that Oribatida communities separated by distances as large as 60 m may not be spatially independent. Soil cores collected within such vicinity should not be used as independent examples of community response to environmental factors, and should not be treated as independent replicates in statistical analysis.

J	Robinson, JG				Robinson, John G.			Ethical pluralism, pragmatism, and sustainability in conservation practice	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Biodiversity; Ethics; Pluralism; Pragmatism; Sustainability	BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; POVERTY; PARTNERSHIPS; VERMEULEN; PEOPLES; DEBATE; POLICY; WORLD; SHEIL; NEEDS	Conservation organizations are asked to be responsive to a number of ethical obligations beyond that of the conservation of biodiversity: the reduction of poverty, the imperative of social justice and cultural integrity, and the improvement in human livelihoods. Yet how a conservation project is designed and structured can negatively impact people's access to resources, privilege one group of people over another, or protect some species at a cost to others. Ideological conflict among nature protectionists, advocates for indigenous people, those promoting a pro-poor agenda, and those seeking to move conservation into the economic mainstream has characterized the conservation debate. I argue that in practice, most conservation programs should adopt a pluralistic and pragmatic approach, adopting multiple goals and making decisions on the basis of what works. Choosing among approaches requires an appreciation of trade-offs, and consideration of biological, social, and cultural values. Ultimately conservation approaches must be sustainable - ecologically, culturally, socially, economically and politically - otherwise they will fail both practically and ethically.

The influence of resource subsidies on cave invertebrates: results from an ecosystem-level manipulation experiment	ECOLOGY			English	Article						allochthonous input; carrion; cave invertebrates; caves; detritus; Greenbrier County, West Virginia, USA; resource-subsidy experiment; spatial subsidies	FOOD WEBS; TERRESTRIAL INVERTEBRATES; ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES; PRODUCTIVITY; DYNAMICS; ISLANDS; ABUNDANCE; RICHNESS; DETRITUS; ENERGY	Spatial resource subsidies can greatly affect the composition and dynamics of recipient communities. Caves are especially tractable for studying spatial subsidies because primary productivity is absent. Here, we performed an ecosystem-level manipulation experiment to test the direct influence of detrital subsidies on community structure in terrestrial cave ecosystems. After performing baseline censuses of invertebrates, we removed all organic material from 12 caves and constructed exclusion boxes to prevent natural resource inputs. Next, we stocked each cave with standardized quantities of two major natural subsidies to caves: leaves (leaf packs) and carcasses (commercially supplied rodents), and measured the invertebrate colonization and utilization of these resources for 23 months. Over the course of the experiment, 102 morphospecies were observed. Diplopods and collembolans were most abundant on leaf packs, and dipteran larvae and collembolans were most abundant on the rats. On average, caves receiving either treatment did not differ in species richness, but abundance was significantly higher in rat caves over both the duration of the experiment and the temporal "life" of the individual resources, which were restocked upon exhaustion. Post-manipulation invertebrate communities differed predictably depending on the type of subsidy introduced. Over the course of the experiment, caves that received the same subsidy clustered together based on community composition. In addition, the invertebrate community utilizing the resource changed over the duration of the two-year experiment, and evidence of succession (i.e., directional change) was observed. Results from this study demonstrate how allochthonous resources can drive the community dynamics of terrestrial invertebrates in cave ecosystems and highlight the need for consideration of the surface environment when managing and protecting these unique habitats.

We also thank the landowners (G. Turner, R. Handley, P. Allison, and P. Callison) for allowing us on their property every month. We thank the many labmates, local biospeleologists, and family members (mom of K. Schneider) who assisted in the field. Taxonomists, especially W. Shear, J. Shultz, F. Soto-Adams, U. Scheller, L. Ferguson, and J. Cokendolpher, provided identifications of some of the organisms collected. D. Culver, G. Dively, J. Gilbert, D. Gruner, J. Hines, B. Jeffery, B. Thorne, H. Martinson Phongsuwan, and several anonymous reviewers provided helpful comments on the content of this manuscript. K. Thompson and K. Liu offered their skills in identifying vertebrate remains. A. Ingling and B. Nellenback were instrumental in quantifying organic material (post-incineration). Collections of cave species were made under permits supplied by the WVDNR (permit numbers 2005.259, 2006.122, 2007.018).

Linking individual behaviour to community scale patterns in fungi	FUNGAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Fungal community dynamics; Fungal interactions; Mathematical model	PLANT DIVERSITY GRADIENT; COEXISTENCE; COMPETITION; DYNAMICS; COLONIES; MYCELIA; SOIL	The fungi comprise a separate kingdom of life and epitomise the indeterminate growth form. Very little is known about the factors that influence the nature of fungal diversity and the link between individual behaviour and the structure and function of fungal communities is particularly poorly understood. Here, we present a theoretical framework that is capable of elucidating this link. An individual-based model for fungal community dynamics is introduced that has been developed from a physiologically based model for the fungal phenotype. The model is used to explore the role of individual interactions, the production of an external inhibitor field and the quality of the external environment on the structure and diversity of the resulting community. We show that traits relating to growth rate, autophagic behaviour and the production of inhibitors are key in influencing the success of a particular genotype in a community. The species richness increases with the amount of available resource. This is the first model of fungal community dynamics that introduces the concept of a biomass-based abundance distribution function that can be described by the log-normal form which typically corresponds to communities in equilibrium. The species abundance curve was stable to changes in the relative location of inocula, although the ranked abundance of the individuals was not. We present the first attempt to identify the traits that affect the form of that curve. Future studies should examine the role of environmental heterogeneity and spore dispersal.

Water mass-specificity of bacterial communities in the North Atlantic revealed by massively parallel sequencing	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						bacterial biogeography; bacterial diversity; deep water masses; massively parallel tag sequencing; North Atlantic Ocean	RIBOSOMAL-RNA GENES; DEEP-SEA; MICROBIAL DIVERSITY; RARE BIOSPHERE; ARCTIC-OCEAN; SAR202 BACTERIOPLANKTON; SAR11 CLUSTER; SARGASSO SEA; GENOMICS; ECOLOGY	Bacterial assemblages from subsurface (100 m depth), meso- (200-1000 m depth) and bathy-pelagic (below 1000 m depth) zones at 10 stations along a North Atlantic Ocean transect from 60 degrees N to 5 degrees S were characterized using massively parallel pyrotag sequencing of the V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene (V6 pyrotags). In a dataset of more than 830 000 pyrotags, we identified 10 780 OTUs of which 52% were singletons. The singletons accounted for less than 2% of the OTU abundance, whereas the 100 and 1000 most abundant OTUs represented 80% and 96% respectively of all recovered OTUs. Non-metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling and Canonical Correspondence Analysis of all the OTUs excluding the singletons revealed a clear clustering of the bacterial communities according to the water masses. More than 80% of the 1000 most abundant OTUs corresponded to Proteobacteria of which 55% were Alphaproteobacteria, mostly composed of the SAR11 cluster. Gammaproteobacteria increased with depth and included a relatively large number of OTUs belonging to Alteromonadales and Oceanospirillales. The bathypelagic zone showed higher taxonomic evenness than the overlying waters, albeit bacterial diversity was remarkably variable. Both abundant and low-abundance OTUs were responsible for the distinct bacterial communities characterizing the major deep-water masses. Taken together, our results reveal that deep-water masses act as bio-oceanographic islands for bacterioplankton leading to water mass-specific bacterial communities in the deep waters of the Atlantic.

J	Bourdages, M; Lavoie, C				Bourdages, Marilou; Lavoie, Claude			Plant introduction and extirpation in a small island park: Natural and anthropogenic rates	ECOSCIENCE			English	Article						exotic species; herbarium specimen; historical ecology; island; park; vascular plant	SPECIES INVASIONS; NATIONAL-PARK; URBAN AREAS; BIODIVERSITY; EXTINCTION; DISPERSAL; FLORA; CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; RESERVE	We conducted a historical (40 y) floristic assessment of a small (4 km(2)) park in eastern Canada (Bonaventure Island National Park, Quebec) to evaluate whether small protected areas located in rural landscapes suffer declines in vascular plant populations. We hypothesized that the limited park access (an island accessible only by boat) has a greater influence than the size of the park per se on the preservation of the integrity of the flora. The island flora just before the creation of the protected area (1971) was compared to the flora surveyed during 2 consecutive summers (2007-2008). Of the 358 taxa that were identified before 1971, only 21 (6% of the total) were not found in 2007-2008; of these 21, all but 1 were native taxa, and 17 are likely extirpated, which represents a "natural" extirpation rate of about 1 taxon every 2 or 3 y. Twenty-four taxa found in 2007-2008 were apparently not present before 1971, 14 native taxa and 10 exotic taxa. This represents an introduction rate of 1 native and 1 exotic species every 2 or 3 y. The creation of the protected area did not totally prevent the extinction of native plants or the introduction of exotic species, but the island lost very few species during recent decades, at least compared to small urban parks where historical floristic assessments have been conducted. These urban parks were visited much more frequently than the island, which probably accounts for most of the differences. Strict regulations for visiting the island are apparently an excellent tool for preventing plant introduction (or extirpation), although they are by no means a barrier against the most invasive species.

The aim of our study is to analyze vegetation changes after passive restoration on two headwaters. Follow-ups of vegetation were carried out using 36 permanent plots of 15 m(2) per brooks during five years. Our results suggest that after restoration, vegetation assemblages are comparable to those present on other headwaters considered in good ecological health. The effectiveness of the passive restoration method employed is discussed in terms of strong potential of resilience for comprehension of ecological functions and in term of sustainability for river managers.

Temporal and Taxonomic Variability in Response of Fauna to Riparian Restoration	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						beta-diversity; indicators; monitoring; restoration; richness; riparian	SACRAMENTO RIVER; SPECIES RICHNESS; COMMUNITY DATA; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; SUCCESS; BIRDS; BIOGEOGRAPHY; ASSEMBLAGES	Evaluating the success of restoration projects requires well-designed studies. Among the decisions that need to be made are what taxonomic groups to study and when to conduct the monitoring. To explore how these decisions can influence assessments of restoration success, we examined species richness and composition data collected over several years on different terrestrial fauna (landbirds, rodents, bees, and beetles) at Sacramento River restoration and remnant riparian sites. Our selection of study organisms enabled us to ask whether variability in species richness among restoration sites is less for vagile taxa than for sedentary taxa, and if invertebrates display greater variability among sites than vertebrates. Our results demonstrate that responses to restoration can vary depending upon the season when it is assessed, and the taxa that are studied. For all taxa except bees, there was considerable variability in the relative performance of taxa at restoration sites from one sampling date to the next, such that the relative ranking of the sites often changed dramatically. Comparisons of beta-diversity (variability in species richness across sites) revealed that certain taxonomic groups were more spatially variable in their response to restoration than others. Among vertebrates, sedentary taxa (rodents) had significantly higher variability in species richness across sites than highly vagile taxa (birds); however, no such pattern was observed for invertebrates. Overall, vertebrates had lower variability than invertebrates, suggesting that evaluations of restoration success based on a few better-known taxonomic groups (e.g., birds, rodents) may be inadequate to represent the biodiversity response of other groups (e.g., insects).

J	Howe, HF				Howe, Henry F.			Fire season and prairie forb richness in a 21-y experiment	ECOSCIENCE			English	Article						experimental restoration; fire season; invasive species; species richness; tallgrass; Wisconsin	PARK GRASS EXPERIMENT; TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; SPECIES RICHNESS; DOMINATED ECOSYSTEMS; PLANT; RESTORATION; DIVERSITY; COMMUNITY; ECOLOGY; DETERMINANTS	An experimental restoration in Wisconsin planted in 1986 tested the hypothesis that growing-season fire maintained richness of native herbaceous dicots (forbs). Replicated plantings were burned in May or July, or left unburned, every third year from 1989 to 2004 and monitored for differences in cover and richness through 2006. Native forb richness was higher in burned than unburned plots, with greatest richness following July burns. Two seasons after the 2004 fires, counts averaged 2 more native forb species in replicates burned in July than those burned in May and 4 more species in replicates burned in July than those left unburned. The strongest statistical response to fire season was higher richness of early-flowering species in replicates burned in July, largely attributable to early-flowering forbs planted in 1986 that persisted better after July burns than in other treatments. Spring fire increased cover of late-flowering C-4 grasses. As of 2006, C-4 grasses accounted for 76% cover after May fires, 52% after July fires, and 39% in unburned plots. Replicates burned in July held more alien species for the first 12 y, after which alien richness declined and differences among treatments disappeared. Summer fire best maintained richness of native, especially early-flowering, species.

Demographic implications of alternative foraging strategies in juvenile loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta of the North Pacific Ocean	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Demography; Ontogeny; Diet; Juvenile; Migration; Habitat use; Utilization distributions	OLIVACEA SEA-TURTLES; BAJA-CALIFORNIA-SUR; MARINE TURTLES; LIFE-HISTORY; BEHAVIORAL PLASTICITY; SATELLITE TELEMETRY; LEATHERBACK TURTLES; PELAGIC HABITAT; FEEDING ECOLOGY; CHELONIA-MYDAS	To assess the potential demographic consequences of alternative juvenile foraging strategies in loggerhead sea turtles Caretta caretta, we compared habitat selection, movement, size frequency, and diet of juvenile loggerheads in neritic versus oceanic habitats of the North Pacific. Forty juveniles satellite-tracked from neritic habitat revealed utilization distributions 2 orders of magnitude smaller than those of 26 juveniles of the same size class tracked for similar durations from oceanic habitat. Oceanic juveniles traveled significantly further, faster and straighter, experienced lower sea surface temperature and productivity, and consumed prey of much lower energy density, strongly suggesting that the neritic foraging strategy is energetically favorable. These findings combined with those from other studies suggest that the neritic strategy would result in higher growth and eventually higher fecundity. Manipulation of a loggerhead demographic model indicated that small disadvantages in survivorship for neritic juveniles could balance the relatively large advantages in growth and fecundity of the neritic strategy. The oceanic strategy may persist as a slower but safer life history strategy. Our findings underscore the importance of elucidating variation in the ecology and corresponding vital rates of juveniles for modeling, managing, and conserving migratory megafaunal populations.

Anurans of Turvo State Park: testing the validity of Seasonal Forest as a new biome in Brazil	JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY			English	Article						community; similarity; richness; reproductive modes	REPRODUCTIVE MODES; SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; CLIMATE; ASSEMBLAGE	The composition of the anuran community of Turvo State Park was compared with that of other localities of Mesophytic semideciduous Forest, aiming to test the hypothesis that localities situated nearest the Misiones nucleus support the new phytogeographic unit, known as Tropical Seasonal Forests Region. In total 32 amphibian species were recorded in the park area and surroundings: Anura, 30 native species and one exotic; Gymnophiona, one species. The ordination among the 20 localities of Seasonal Forest showed the formation of three groups with 45% similarity: group 1, composed of localities of south-eastern and central western regions; group 2, composed of the localities of the transitional portion with the Atlantic Forest sensu stricto and group 3, composed of the southern localities. The consolidation of the second group, which includes the occurrence of endemic species, supports the proposal of a new phytogeographic unit.	[Iop, S.; Caldart, V. M.; Cechin, S.

Hence, a floristic and phytosociological inventory was conducted in a cerrado (stricto sensu) area, located in the Parque Estadual da Serra de Caldas Novas, state of Goias, Brazil, comparing the quantitative and qualitative results with those from other 15 areas. Fifty plots of 20x20m (2ha) were established and all trees with CSH(30) >15cm were included in the study. A total of 70 species, 51 genera and 31 families were found at the site. Fabaceae was the richest family (with 13 species), followed by Vochysiaceae (7). The highest importance values were for Tabebuia aurea Benth. & Hook, Kielmeyera coriacea Mart. & Zucc and Qualea parviflora Mart. The floristic comparative analysis showed that geographic distance was the most important parameter, followed by other environmental factors. The quantitative structural patterns reflect variations in more reduced scale, probably under strong influence of environmental variations.

Often, however, there are no consistent baseline vegetation or wildlife data for assessing the status of biodiversity elements across protected and managed areas for conservation planning, nor is there a rapid and efficient means to acquire those data. We used a unified vegetation classification and simple animal sampling design to describe the patterns of abundance of selected mammals as indicator, or characteristic, species in different vegetation types and protected areas vs. managed forest units in the Terai Conservation Area (TCA) in northern Uttar Pradesh state, India. We quantified the relative abundance of 15 mammals of conservation concern from dung counts in vegetation sampling plots within 122 sample patches in 13 vegetation types and 4 management units. Assemblages of species differed both among vegetation types and among management units. Species assemblages in the two protected areas differed strongly from those in two managed forests. Grasslands in protected areas were the most species diverse among vegetation types and had several indicator species. Protected forests were dominated by chital (Axis axis) and nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) in a second species group. A third species group in open grasslands and savannas in managed forests was characterized by cattle (Bos taurus) and Indian hare (Lepus nigricollis). Protected areas clearly are the core conservation area of the TCA for their relatively high habitat value and species diversity, and their protected status minimizes human disturbance. Impacts of human use are high in managed forests, indicating their compromised value for biodiversity conservation. Our simple assessment methodology gives managers a simple way to assess the status of important mammals across landscape conservation units.

Species accumulation over space and time in European Plio-Holocene mammals	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY			English	Article						Species-area relationship; Species-time relationship; Species-time-area relationship; Ice age mammals	AREA RELATIONSHIP; FOSSIL MAMMALS; NORTH-AMERICA; RED QUEEN; DIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS; CURVES; PLIOPLEISTOCENE	The rate of increase in species number with sampled area is one issue of major interest in ecology. Species number increases with sampled time as well, though this kind of analysis is much rarer in literature. Species-area and species-time relationships have been recently integrated in a single model, which allows studying how time and area interact with each other in determining the cumulative increase in species richness. Here we studied species-area, species-time, and species-time-area relationships in Plio-Holocene large mammals of Western Eurasia, by using an extensive database including 184 species distributed in 685 fossil sites. We found that the increase of species number with time is much higher than with area. When sampling inequality of fossil localities in time and space is accounted for, time and area interact with each other in a negative, though non-linear fashion. The intense climatic changes that characterized the Plio-Holocene period apparently affected both species-area and species-time relationships in large mammals, by increasing the slope of the former during the Pliocene and middle Pleistocene, and of the latter during younger, climatically harsher, late Pleistocene times. This study emphasizes the importance of accounting for time and space in tracing paleodiversity curves.

This asymmetry in social roles of the two sexes has led social insect researchers to focus almost exclusively on the females whereas males have remained relatively neglected. We studied two sympatric, primitively eusocial wasps, Ropalidia marginata and Ropalidia cyathiformis, and compared the morphological and behavioural profiles of males and females. Males of both species are smaller in size and weigh less compared to females. Males of the two species live in the nest for different durations. Borrowing from the ecological literature we use novel methods to compute and compare behavioural diversity and behavioural richness and show that females of both species are behaviourally richer and more diverse than the males.

Although several nestedness indices have been proposed, few have explored how species abundance per se affects their performance and the ability to detect true interaction networks. We here develop a mathematical framework that takes into account abundance in estimates of nestedness. We use an analytical approach to relate abundance and nestedness. In our null model the probability of interaction among species is determined solely as function of their abundances. Assuming a power-law abundance model we analytically find the nestedness index and its coefficient of variability. We find that the sloping abundance distribution of our null model generates more nested structures. On the other hand steeper abundances lead to higher coefficients of variability. Both results suggest that nestedness analysis should be evaluated and explanations sought carefully. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Seasonal diet preferences of black rhinoceros in three arid South African National Parks	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						browse; Diceros bicornis; diet; diversity; preference; utilization	DICEROS-BICORNIS MINOR; FISH RIVER RESERVE; QUALITY; KENYA	Black rhinoceros diet and browse availability was investigated in Augrabies Falls (AFNP), Karoo (KRNP) and Vaalbos National Parks (VNP) in South Africa. Rhino tracks were followed and 18,804 standard bite volumes recorded. Browse availability of each plant species was recorded by measuring 14,800 plants and calculating reachable browse volume. The diet comprised 51, 53 and 41 plant species in AFNP, KRNP and VNP, respectively, but three species accounted for more than 65% of the diet in each park, making diet less diverse than available browse in AFNP and KRNP. Browse availability explained 14%, 15% and 52% of diet selection in AFNP, KRNP and VNP, with consumption of most plant species significantly different from availability. A few plant species were so highly preferred that browsing intensities were unsustainable, while some common species were totally rejected. Pressure on the eaten browse averaged 4.4%, 14.5% and 1.3% annually of the volume in AFNP, KRNP and VNP. In the dry season, there was a two to sevenfold increase in browsing pressure on species with actively photosynthesizing tissues. A few key species, including Monechma and Zygophyllum species, were identified as potential early warning indicators of black rhino browsing impact.Resume	[Knight, Mike H.] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Ctr African Conservat, Port Elizabeth, South Africa	Buk, KG (reprint author), Birkeroed Parkvej 38 St Th, DK-3460 Birkerod, Denmark.	kenbuk@kenbuk.com			Frimodt's Fund; WWF-Denmark; HRH Crownprince Frederiks's Fund; Burne's Fund; Maanson's Scholarship	Frimodt's Fund, WWF-Denmark, HRH Crownprince Frederiks's Fund, Burne's Fund and Maanson's Scholarship are thanked for funding.

A test using functional measures on three continents	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Community structure; Monopolisation; Discovery; Microhabitat; Experiment	SIZE-GRAIN HYPOTHESIS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; BODY-SIZE; COMPETITION; ASSEMBLAGES; PARASITOIDS; COEXISTENCE; TEMPERATURE; IRIDOMYRMEX; VEGETATION	Habitat complexity can mediate key processes that structure local assemblages through effects on factors such as competition, predation and foraging behaviour. While most studies address assemblage responses to habitat complexity within one locality, a more global approach allows conclusions with greater independence from the phylogenetic constraints of the target assemblages, thus allowing greater generality. We tested the effects of natural and manipulated habitat complexities on ant assemblages from South Africa, Australia and Sweden, in order to determine if there were globally consistent responses in how functional measures of foraging success are regulated by habitat complexity. Specifically, we considered how habitat complexity affected ant foraging rates including the speed of discovery and rate of monopolisation. We also tested if habitat complexity affected the body size index, a size-related morphological trait, of ants discovering resources and occupying and monopolising the resources after 180 min. Ants were significantly slower to discover baits in the more complex treatments, consistent with predictions that they would move more slowly through more complex environments. The monopolisation index was also lower in the more complex treatments, suggesting that resources were more difficult to defend. Our index of ant body size showed trends in the predicted direction for complexity treatments. In addition, ants discovering, occupying and monopolising resources were smaller in simple than in complex natural habitats. Responses of discovering ants to resources in natural habitats were clear in only one of three regions. Consistent with our predictions, habitat complexity thus affected functional measures of the foraging success of ants in terms of measures of discovery and monopolisation rates and body size traits of successful ants. However, patterns were not always equally clear in manipulative and mensurative components of the study.

One collection comprising 100 samples was made from an artificial lake, which had been made by damming a stream running through a secondary forest. The other collection comprising 90 samples was made from an adjacent non dammed shallow stream running through a similar forest. A total of 68 fungal taxa were recorded during the study and the Shannon-Weiner index (H') was applied to evaluate the diversities of freshwater fungi. Sorensen's index (S') was calculated to evaluate the similarity of different fungal communities. The variation of freshwater fungi on submerged wood between lentic and lotic habitat is discussed and compared with previous studies. A dramatic decrease in species richness and diversity, with significantly changed species composition were observed in the artificial lake as compared to the non dammed stream.

Bigger is not always better: Offspring size does not predict growth or survival for seven ascidian species	ECOLOGY			English	Article						ascidian; growth rate; offspring size; size-quality tradeoff; survival; tunicate	MARINE HARD SUBSTRATA; EGG SIZE; SEED MASS; SOLITARY ASCIDIANS; REPRODUCTIVE PATTERNS; ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; PSYCHOTRIA RUBIACEAE; COLONIAL STRATEGIES; CIONA-INTESTINALIS	The presumed trade-off between offspring size and quality predicted by life history theory is often invoked to explain the wide range of propagule sizes observed in animals and plants. This trade-off is broadly supported by intraspecific studies but has been difficult to test in an interspecific context, particularly in animals. We tested the fitness consequences of offspring size both intra-and interspecifically for seven species of ascidians (sessile, suspension-feeding, marine invertebrates) whose offspring volumes varied over three orders of magnitude. We measured two major components of fitness, juvenile growth rates and survival, in laboratory and field experiments encompassing several food conditions. Contrary to the predictions of life history theory, larger offspring size did not result in higher rates of growth or survival, and large offspring did not perform better under nutritional stress, either intraspecifically or interspecifically. In fact, two of the four species with small offspring grew rapidly enough to catch up in size to the species with large offspring in as little as eight weeks, under wild-type food conditions. Trade-offs between growth potential and defense may overwhelm and obscure any trade-offs between offspring size and survival or growth rate. While large initial size may still confer a competitive advantage, we failed to detect any consequences of interspecific variation in initial size. This implies that larger offspring in these species, far from being inherently superior in growth or survival, require compensation in other aspects of life history if reproductive effort is to be efficient. Our results suggest that the importance of initial offspring size is context dependent and often overestimated relative to other life history traits.

J	Lawes, RA; Grice, AC				Lawes, R. A.; Grice, A. C.			War of the weeds: Competition hierarchies in invasive species	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						abundance; community; competition; competition hierarchy; David Score; invasive species	PLANT-COMMUNITIES; NUTRIENT GRADIENT; DOMINANCE; GRASSES; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; RANKING; ECOLOGY; GROWTH	Invasive plant species succeed because they are able to propagate and disperse into unoccupied habitat, outcompete and suppress other plant species or use a combination of these two strategies. Ecosystems are often invaded by multiple species and it is important to determine which species are likely to dominate plant communities through competition and which species will succeed by other means. We assessed frequency and abundance of 65 invasive species over 1700 km of riparian zone in the Burdekin catchment of North Queensland, Australia and established a dominance hierarchy for those species. The cover of every invasive and one native shrub known to have increased in abundance in historical times, was surveyed in quadrats as part of a nested hierarchical design consisting of 8030 quadrats, within 803 transects, within 90 sites. Total species cover and species frequency were derived from the results of this survey. We estimated the pairwise interactions between individual species and used a non-parametric David Score to rank species and construct a competition hierarchy of invasive species at the quadrat and transect levels. Species frequency and cover were highly correlated (r2 = 0.81). The competition hierarchy of species at the quadrat level was moderately related to species cover, but poorly related to species frequency (r2 = 0.24 and 0.02). The competition rank of many species, including Urochloa mosambicensis and Parthenium hysterophorus, changed markedly with scale when assessed at the quadrat and transect levels. This suggests different processes influenced their competitive success at different scales. This technique enabled us to explore and accept the hypothesis that abundant species are often the most competitive. However, some exceptions were identified in this study and these species may in time become more abundant in the catchment.	[Lawes, R.

J	Lindenmayer, D; Hunter, M				Lindenmayer, David; Hunter, Malcolm			Some Guiding Concepts for Conservation Biology	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						conservation biology; conservation goals; conservation strategies; constraints to conservation; improved conservation practice	BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS; FOREST MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CORAL-REEFS; THRESHOLDS; ECOLOGY; RESPONSES; POPULATION; INDICATORS; DIVERSITY	The search for generalities in ecology has often been thwarted by contingency and ecological complexity that limit the development of predictive rules. We present a set of concepts that we believe succinctly expresses some of the fundamental ideas in conservation biology. (1) Successful conservation management requires explicit goals and objectives. (2) The overall goal of biodiversity management will usually be to maintain or restore biodiversity, not to maximize species richness. (3) A holistic approach is needed to solve conservation problems. (4) Diverse approaches to management can provide diverse environmental conditions and mitigate risk. (5) Using nature's template is important for guiding conservation management, but it is not a panacea. (6) Focusing on causes not symptoms enhances efficacy and efficiency of conservation actions. (7) Every species and ecosystem is unique, to some degree. (8) Threshold responses are important but not ubiquitous. (9) Multiple stressors often exert critical effects on species and ecosystems. (10) Human values are variable and dynamic and significantly shape conservation efforts. We believe most conservation biologists will broadly agree these concepts are important. That said, an important part of the maturation of conservation biology as a discipline is constructive debate about additional or alternative concepts to those we have proposed here. Therefore, we have established a web-based, online process for further discussion of the concepts outlined in this paper and developing additional ones.

Four localities were sampled, and in each locality, three habitats were surveyed: dense forest, open forest or woodland savannah and shrub savannah. This is the first comprehensive inventory for small mammals in central Benin. We captured 794 small mammals representing twenty species (six shrew species, fourteen rodent species). Three new species that need to be described were recorded. We observed a mixture of both true forest species and of species adapted to a wider range of habitats ranging from savannah to forest clearings. Species with either Sudanian or Guinea-Congolian affinities were recorded, as well as a new species endemic to Togo and Benin. This rich biodiversity underlines the urgent need for an effective protection of these forests. The Sudanian species Crocidura cf. foxi was more abundant in Wari-Maro than in Agoua forest, while the Guineo-Congolian species Praomys misonnei and Hylomyscus sp were only captured in Agoua forest. These results are in agreement with the fact that these two forests belong to two distinct chorological zones.Resume	[Nicolas, Violaine; Delapre, Arnaud] Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Systemat & Evolut, UMR 7205, Lab Mammiferes & Oiseaux,USM 601, F-75005 Paris, France; [Natta, Armand] Univ Parakou, Dept Amenagement & Gest Environm, Fac Agron, Parakou, Benin; [Barriere, Patrick] CREG AICA, Bourail 98870, New Caledonia; [Colyn, Marc] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, Biol Stn, UMR 6553, F-35380 Paimpont, France	Nicolas, V (reprint author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Systemat & Evolut, UMR 7205, Lab Mammiferes & Oiseaux,USM 601, 57 Rue Cuvier,CP51, F-75005 Paris, France.	vnicolas@mnhn.fr			PAMF	This programme was funded by the PAMF project (Projet d'Amenagement des Massifs Forestiers d'Agoua, des Monts Kouffe et de Wari-Maro).

Fires may create conditions that facilitate species invasions, but the degree to which this occurs in different tropical plant communities has not been quantified. We documented the survival and establishment of plant species for 2 yr following 2003 wildfires in tropical moist and wet forest life zones in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii. Fires were ignited by lava flows and burned across a steep environmental gradient encompassing two previously burned shrub-dominated communities and three Metrosideros polymorpha forest communities. Fires in all community types were stand replacing, where >95 percent of overstory trees were top killed. Over half (>57%) of the trees survived via basal sprouting, but sprout growth differed among forest communities. Sprout growth (4250,000 cm(3)) was greatest in the forest community where postfire understory cover was lowest presumably due to thick native Dicranopteris linearis fern litter that remained postfire. In contrast, M. polymorpha sprout growth was much slower (<100,000 cm(3)) in the two forest communities where there was rapid understory recovery of nonnative ferns Nephrolepis multiflora and invasive grassesPaspalum conjugatum. These results suggest that the rapid establishment of an invasive-dominated understory limited recovery of the overstory dominant M. polymorpha. In contrast to the three forest communities, there were few changes in vegetation composition in the shrubland communities. Nonnative species invasions coupled with repeated fires selectively eliminated fire-sensitive species thereby maintaining these communities in dominance of primarily nonnative, fire-resilient, species.

Establishment of the invasive perennial Vincetoxicum rossicum across a disturbance gradient in New York State, USA	PLANT ECOLOGY			English	Article						Biotic resistance; Dog-strangling vine; Environmental gradient; Invasibility; Pale swallow-wort; Weed ecology	BUTTERFLIES DANAUS-PLEXIPPUS; EXOTIC PLANT INVASIONS; SEEDLING ESTABLISHMENT; BIOTIC RESISTANCE; INVASIBILITY; PERFORMANCE; DIVERSITY; SPREAD; ENVIRONMENTS; OVIPOSITION	Vincetoxicum rossicum (pale swallow-wort) is a non-native, perennial, herbaceous vine in the Apocynaceae. The species' abundance is steadily increasing in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. Little is known about Vincetoxicum species recruitment and growth. Therefore, we conducted a field experiment in New York State to address this knowledge gap. We determined the establishment, survival, and growth of V. rossicum during the first 2 years after sowing in two old fields subjected to four disturbance regimens. We hypothesized that establishment and survival would be higher in treatments with greater disturbance. At the better-drained location, overall establishment was 15 +/- A 1% [mean +/- A standard error] and did not differ among treatments. At the poorly drained location, establishment varied by treatment; mowed and control plots had greater establishment [10 +/- A 2%] than herbicide + tillage and herbicide-only plots [1.6 +/- A 0.5%]. Of those seedlings that emerged, overall survival was high at both locations (70-84%). Similarly, total (above + belowground) biomass was greater in herbicide + tillage and herbicide-only plots than in mowed and control plots at both locations. Thus, V. rossicum was successful in establishing and surviving across a range of disturbance regimens particularly relative to other old field species, but growth was greater in more disturbed treatments. The relatively high-establishment rates in old field habitats help explain the invasiveness of this Vincetoxicum species in the northeastern U.S. and southeastern Canada.

Twenty-four 30 x 30-m plots were fenced in 12 ha of pasture in 2006. Seeds were collected in ninety-six 1-m(-2) seed traps; recruits were censused in similar to 12,000 m(2) in which establishment was allowed. We tested effects of distance from forest, living trees, and stumps of trees cut during site preparation on seed rain in 2007 and effects of these and soil depth on recruits through June 2008. Seed fall and recruitment were not correlated with distance to forest 90-400 m away, nor to living shade trees outside the 160 x 485-m experimental grid. Recruitment differed for animal- and wind-dispersed species in a topographically complex landscape. Recruitment of wind-dispersed species was random with respect to soil depth or distance to recent stumps. Recruitment of animal-dispersed species was multimodal; partial correlations with number of stumps within 30 m of plots were significant with soil depth held constant (P < 0.025), as were correlations of recruitment with soil depth with number of stumps held constant (P < 0.01). Animal-dispersed recruits were often not conspecifics of adults that had been cut, indicating a legacy of attraction by fruiting trees of animals bearing seeds from distant sources. Ecological implications are that recruitment in pastures released from grazing reflects a mix of widely scattered wind-dispersed pioneers and, where animal-dispersed trees exist, multi-modal and decidedly non-random recruitment of pioneer and later successional animal-dispersed trees from seed banks.

This study addressed two questions regarding the role of temporary pools in supporting diversity of riparian vegetation in a regulated river in Japan: (1) do temporary pools maintain high native riparian plant species diversity? And, (2) how do physical environmental factors affect the pattern of plant species distribution? The study was conducted on a 1-km section of the Hayade River alluvial fan in Niigata Prefecture, central Japan. Two to five transect belts consisting of 20 contiguous plots (1 m x 1 m) were laid out in two off-channel temporary pools and six other sites classified by physiognomy. Vascular plant presence, relative elevation, and substratum type were recorded in all plots. Species richness, Simpson's reciprocal index (1/D), and Shannon-Wiener function (H') were calculated by life form to estimate plant species diversity. Two conclusions could be drawn from the results. First, the temporary pools maintained high native riparian plant species diversity in this regulated river floodplain. Second, several environmental factors (seasonal wet-dry cycle, low elevation, complex micro-topography, and fine substrata) created spatial and seasonal heterogeneity of moisture conditions in the temporary pools, supporting plant species diversity. For sustainable maintenance of riparian plant species diversity, progressive river-management should restore original riverine dynamics to generate a shifting mosaic of diverse geomorphology.

Traditionally established by experts based on qualitative evidence, the lack of transparency and quantitative support has set constraints on their utility. The recent availability of global species range maps, novel multivariate techniques and enhanced computational power now enable a quantitative scrutiny and extension of biogeographical regionalizations that will facilitate new and more rigorous uses. In this paper we develop and illustrate a methodological roadmap for species-level biogeographical regionalizations at the global scale and apply it to mammals. Location Global. Methods We explore the relative usefulness of ordination and clustering methods and validation techniques. The performance of nine different clustering algorithms is tested at different taxonomic levels. The grain of regionalization (i.e. the number of clusters) will usually be driven by the purpose of the study, but we present several approaches that provide guidance. Results Non-metric multidimensional scaling offers a valuable first step in identifying and illustrating biogeographical transition zones. For the clustering of regions, the nine different hierarchical clustering methods varied greatly in utility, with UPGMA (unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages) agglomerative hierarchical clustering having consistently the best performance. The UPGMA approach allows a tree-like phenetic representation of the relative distances of regions and can be applied at different levels of taxonomic resolution. We find that the new quantitative biogeographical regions exhibit both striking similarities to and differences from the classic primary geographical divisions of the world's biota. Specifically, our results provide evidence that the Sahara, northern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and parts of the Middle East should be regarded as part of the Afrotropics. Further, the position of the New Guinean continental shelf, Lydekker's Line, is supported as an appropriate border to separate the Oriental and Australian regions. Main conclusions We propose that this sort of new, quantitative delineation and relationship assessment across taxonomic and geographical grains is likely to offer opportunities for more rigorous inference in historical and ecological biogeography and conservation.

Invasive Temperate Species are a Threat to Tropical Island Biodiversity	BIOTROPICA			English	Article						alien; altitude; biogeographical patterns; Hawaii; invasion; land snails; mollusc	HAWAIIAN-ISLANDS; LAND SNAILS; NONMARINE MOLLUSKS; PLANT INVASIONS; PATTERNS; PACIFIC; DECLINE; SLUGS; BIOGEOGRAPHY; EXTINCTIONS	To protect the remaining biodiversity on tropical islands it is important to predict the elevational ranges of non-native species. We evaluated two hypotheses by examining land snail faunas on the eastern (windward) side of the island of Hawaii: (1) the latitude of a species' native region can be used to predict its potential elevational range and (2) non-native temperate species, which experience greater climatic fluctuations in their native range, are more likely to become established at higher elevations and to extend over larger elevational ranges than non-native tropical species. All non-native tropical species were distributed patchily among sites <= 500m and occupied small elevational ranges, whereas species introduced from temperate regions occupied wide elevational ranges and formed a distinct fauna spanning elevations 500-2000m. Most native land snail species and ecosystems occur >500m in areas dominated by temperate non-native snail and slug species. Therefore, knowing the native latitudinal region of a non-native species is important for conservation of tropical island ecosystems because it can be translated into potential elevational range if those species are introduced. Because temperate species will survive in tropical locales particularly at high elevation, on many tropical islands the last refuges of the native species, preventing introduction of temperate species should be a conservation priority.

Trumbull, Arizona, U.S.A. The goal of the project was to alter forest structure by thinning and burning to more closely resemble forest conditions prior to Euro-American settlement in 1870. We measured 117 permanent plots before (1996/1997) and after (2003) treatments. The plots were evenly distributed across the landscape (approximately 1,200 ha), about half of which was an untreated control. We evaluated treatment implementation and effectiveness based on 1870 structure and/or goals outlined by managers. The success of treatment implementation varied: about 94% of the area originally planned for restoration was treated in some manner by 2003, but only 70% received the full planned treatment (thin and burn). Although density of ponderosa pines > 2.5 cm was reduced significantly by 66% from approximately 429 pines/ha to approximately 146 pines/ha in the treated area, the targeted residual density was exceeded by 111-256% (all plots) or 10-85% (thinned and burned plots). Thirteen percent of the pre-settlement pines died in the treated area by 2003, but 9% percent also died in the control, indicating that pre-settlement pines in untreated areas were nearly as vulnerable as those exposed to restoration treatments. Large snags increased 45%, and 65% of logs > 50 cm were retained, achieving implementation goals. Although restoration treatments were not implemented totally to specifications, they were effective in attaining the overall project goal of restoring more open forest structure while preserving more than 75% of the pre-settlement pines. Canopy fuel loads were substantially reduced, allowing for the reintroduction of surface fires.	[Roccaforte, John P.; Fule, Peter Z.; Covington, W.

Unrealized Expectations for Restoration of a Floodplain Plant Community	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						broadleaf marsh; depth; hydroperiod; Kissimmee River; Ludwigia peruviana	CHANNELIZED KISSIMMEE RIVER; ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; VEGETATION DEVELOPMENT; WETLAND RESTORATION; SEED BANKS; ECOSYSTEM; WATER; MARSHES; SUBMERGENCE; PERFORMANCE	The ongoing restoration of the channelized Kissimmee River is expected to promote reestablishment of the prolonged, deep inundation regimes that sustained broadleaf marsh as the dominant wetland plant community on the historical floodplain. The success of the restoration was evaluated at locations on the remnant floodplain where broadleaf marsh had been replaced by a mesophytic shrub community, and on the lower portion of the reconstructed floodplain, which was recreated by backfilling of a flood control canal and degradation of associated spoil mounds. During the 8-year post-restoration period (2001-2008) mean annual hydroperiods and depths on the restored floodplain were not significantly different from pre-channelization hydrologic conditions at historical reference sites. Increased hydroperiods and depths eliminated the mesophytic shrub (primarily Myrica cerifera) and associated fern cover, and led to colonization of floating and mat-forming species, but did not result in the reestablishment of a broadleaf marsh community. Signature broadleaf marsh species, Sagittaria lancifolia and Pontederia cordata, were found in all remnant floodplain plots and colonized 8 of the 10 reconstructed floodplain plots, but had mean cover ranging from only 0.9 to 6.1%. Several factors may have contributed to unsuccessful reestablishment of broadleaf marsh, including unfavorable edaphic conditions, brief drawdown (low stage) periods for establishment of seedlings, flood induced mortality, and an invasion of the exotic shrub, Ludwigia peruviana, which had post-restoration mean cover of 17-19%. Study results indicate hydrologic restoration of floodplain plant communities can be influenced by more discrete aspects of the river flood pulse than average hydroperiods and depths.

J	Williamson, M				Williamson, Mark			Why do species abundance distributions of individuals and of biomass behave differently under sampling?	OIKOS			English	Article							NULL HYPOTHESIS	A surprising and important difference between species abundance distributions (SADs) of individuals and of biomass has been found in a wide variety of taxa. On sampling, individuals SADs are 'veiled', the left tail is missing, to an extent depending on the sampling intensity, while biomass SADs appear not to be veiled. The explanation offered here is that sampling is always of individuals, biomass is sampled only indirectly. Graphs of the community of birds in an English wood show how the explanation works. Biomass SADs are different from individuals SADs.

Multiple mechanisms underlie displacement of solitary Hawaiian Hymenoptera by an invasive social wasp	ECOLOGY			English	Article						exploitative competition; Hawaii; Hylaeus; invasions; Nesodynerus; predation; Vespula pensylvanica; yellowjacket	HYLAEUS BEES HYMENOPTERA; PH DECLINE; BODY-SIZE; BEHAVIOR; LEPIDOPTERA; COLLETIDAE; INVERTEBRATES; COMMUNITIES; POPULATIONS; ECOSYSTEMS	Variation in invasion success may result from the divergent evolutionary histories of introduced species compared to those of native taxa. The vulnerability of native biotas to ecological disruption may be especially great on oceanic islands invaded by continental species with unique ecological traits. In part because Hawaii lacks native eusocial insects, social invaders may threaten endemic taxa that are ecologically similar but solitary. Using a combination of field manipulations, molecular analyses, physiological data, and behavioral assays, we identify the mechanisms underlying the displacement of two genera of native solitary Hymenoptera in Hawaii by a social continental invader, the western yellowjacket (Vespula pensylvanica). Experimental removal of V. pensylvanica colonies resulted in increased densities of native Hymenoptera. Endemic Hylaeus bees directly suffer through predation by yellowjackets, and perhaps as a consequence, avoid floral resources occupied by V. pensylvanica. Native Nesodynerus wasps also avoid V. pensylvanica but are negatively affected by yellowjackets not through predation, but through exploitative competition for caterpillar prey. Displacement of native solitary Hymenoptera may be heightened by the ability of V. pensylvanica to prey upon and scavenge honey bees and to rob their honey stores, resources unavailable to endemic bees and wasps because of their specialized niches. Our study provides a unique example of an ecologically generalized social invader that restructures native assemblages of solitary Hymenoptera by interacting with endemic taxa on multiple trophic levels.

In this context the question of genetic divergence and speciation in ecosystems is one of the most intriguing and complex challenges nowadays. The current manuscript aims to investigate the aforementioned problem by means of extensive computer simulations. Here we introduce a spatial model of evolution which assumes viability selection, mutations and random mating. The population evolves in a heterogeneous environment where the habitat diversity is an input of the model. As a model for the fitness landscape a variation of the NK model is assumed. We present results for the time evolution of fitness and genetic divergence and address the species-area relationship. The dependence of the quantities and scalings of the problem with epistasis is investigated. Depending on the mutation rate, the species-area relationship displays either two-phase or a triphasic scenario. In any case, for intermediate and large system sizes the relationship is well described by a power-law, with exponents within the range of values observed in real ecological niches. All the quantities show a strong dependence on the epistasis parameter. According to our simulations, a lower level of genetic divergence is needed in order to ensure sexual isolation when interactions among genes is strong. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we develop an integrated economic-ecological spatial optimization model that we then apply to evaluate alternate forest policies on a 560,000 km(2) study region of managed boreal forest in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada. The integrated model incorporates dynamic forest sector harvesting, current levels of oil and gas sector development, coarse-filter or habitat-based old forest indicators, a set of empirical forest bird abundance models, and statistical models of the natural and current fire regimes. Using our integrated model, economic tradeoff curves, or production possibility frontiers, are developed to illustrate the cost of achieving coarse-filter targets by a set time (50 years) within a 100-year time horizon. We found levels of ecological indicators and economic returns from the timber industry could both be increased if spatial constraints imposed by the current policy environment were relaxed; other factors being equal, this implies current policy should be revised. We explore the production possibility frontier's relationship to the range of natural variation of old forest habitat, and show how this range can be used to guide choices of preferred locations along the frontier. We also show that coarse-filter constraints on the abundance of certain habitat elements are sufficient to satisfy some fine-filter objectives, expressed as the predicted abundances of various species of songbirds.

In the absence of estimates of these values, there will likely be less investment in conservation actions that generate substantial nonuse benefits, such as conservation of native species. To help overcome decisions about the allocation of conservation dollars that reflect the lack of estimates of nonuse values, these values can be estimated indirectly by environmental value transfer (EVT). EVT uses existing data or information from a study site such that the estimated monetary value of an environmental good is transferred to another location or policy site. A major challenge in the use of EVT is the uncertainty about the sign and size of the error (i.e., the percentage by which transferred value exceeds the actual value) that results from transferring direct estimates of nonuse values from a study to a policy site, the site where the value is transferred. An EVT is most useful if the decision-making framework does not require highly accurate information and when the conservation decision is constrained by time and financial resources. To account for uncertainty in the decision-making process, a decision heuristic that guides the decision process and illustrates the possible decision branches, can be followed. To account for the uncertainty associated with the transfer of values from one site to another, we developed a risk and simulation approach that uses Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the net benefits of conservation investments and takes into account different possible distributions of transfer error. This method does not reduce transfer error, but it provides a way to account for the effect of transfer error in conservation decision making. Our risk and simulation approach and decision-based framework on when to use EVT offer better-informed decision making in conservation.	[Akter, Sonia; Grafton, R.

We studied whether tree species influence patchiness in diversity and abundance of three common soil arthropod taxa (ants, gamasid mites, and oribatid mites) in a Panama forest. The tree specialization hypothesis proposes that tree-driven habitat heterogeneity maintains litter arthropod diversity. We tested whether tree species differed in resource quality and quantity of their leaf litter and whether more heterogeneous litter supports more arthropod species. Alternatively, the abundance-extinction hypothesis states that arthropod diversity increases with arthropod abundance, which in turn tracks resource quantity (e.g., litter depth). We found little support for the hypothesis that tropical trees are templates for litter arthropod diversity. Ten tree species differed in litter depth, chemistry, and structural variability. However, the extent of specialization of invertebrates on particular tree taxa was low and the more heterogeneous litter between trees failed to support higher arthropod diversity. Furthermore, arthropod diversity did not track abundance or litter depth. The lack of association between tree species and litter arthropods suggests that factors other than tree species diversity may better explain the high arthropod diversity in tropical forests.

Patterns of functional and taxonomic organization of stream fishes: inferences based on alpha, beta, and gamma diversities	ECOGRAPHY			English	Article							LIFE-HISTORY STRATEGIES; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; SCALE DEPENDENCE; SPATIAL SCALES; TRAITS; SIMILARITY; COMPONENTS; GRADIENTS	The primary objective of this study was to determine whether total biodiversity (gamma) is partitioned into within-community (alpha) and among-community (beta) components differently for taxonomic and functional organization. I hypothesized that alpha diversity will contribute more to the functional organization of gamma diversity and that beta diversity will contribute more to the taxonomic organization of gamma diversity. A secondary objective was to determine whether the relationship between taxonomic and functional diversity is scale dependent. Species abundance data was obtained from fisheries surveys conducted by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Dept that focused on least disturbed streams from 11 different ecoregions of Texas, including 62 localities from 18 drainages. Functional and taxonomic organization of assemblages was quantified with two different measures of biodiversity, including richness and the numbers equivalent of Shannon diversity. Scale-dependent effects on these indices were assessed by multiplicatively partitioning gamma into alpha and beta components. The contribution of alpha and beta components to gamma diversity differed between functional and taxonomic organization and among different measures of biodiversity. Among-community components were more influential in structuring the taxonomic organization of stream-fish assemblages, whereas within-community components were more important in structuring the functional organization of assemblages. The relationship between taxonomic and functional diversity differed between alpha and beta components and between spatial scales. Indeed, ecological patterns not only change with spatial scale, but how they change is dependent on which aspect of biodiversity is considered.

Predicting the effects of increasing temporal scale on species composition, diversity, and rank-abundance distributions	PALEOBIOLOGY			English	Article							MOLLUSCAN DEATH ASSEMBLAGES; BRACHIOPOD SHELL ACCUMULATIONS; FORAMINIFERAL TIME-SERIES; AREA RELATIONSHIP; FOSSIL ASSEMBLAGES; BETA-DIVERSITY; ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES; DISPERSAL-LIMITATION; ALPHA-DIVERSITY; PALEOECOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE	Paleoecological analyses that test for spatial or temporal variation in diversity must consider not only sampling and preservation bias, but also the effects of temporal scale (i.e., time-averaging). The species-time relationship (STR) describes how species diversity increases with the elapsed time of observation, but its consequences for assessing the effects of time-averaging on diversity of fossil assemblages remain poorly explored. Here, we use a neutral, dispersal-limited model of metacommunity dynamics, with parameters estimated from living assemblages of 31 molluscan data sets, to model the effects of within-habitat time-averaging on the mean composition and multivariate dispersion of assemblages, on diversity at point (single station) and habitat scales (pooled multiple stations), and on beta diversity. We hold sample size constant in STRs to isolate the effects of time-averaging from sampling effects. With increasing within-habitat time-averaging, stochastic switching in the identity of species in living (dispersal-limited) assemblages (1) decreases the proportional abundance of abundant species, reducing the steepness of the rank-abundance distribution, and (2) increases the proportional richness of rare, temporally short-lived species that immigrate from the neutral metacommunity with many rare species. These two effects together (1) can shift the mean composition away from the non-averaged (dispersal-limited) assemblages toward averaged assemblages that are less limited by dispersal, resembling that of the metacommunity; (2) allow the point and habitat diversity to increase toward metacommunity diversity under a given sample size (i.e., the diversity in averaged assemblages is inflated relative to non-averaged assemblages); and (3) reduce beta diversity because species unique to individual stations become shared by other stations when limited by a larger but static species pool. Surprisingly, these scale-dependent changes occur at fixed sample sizes and can become significant after only a few decades or centuries of time-averaging, and are accomplished without invoking ecological succession, environmental changes, or selective postmortem preservation. Time-averaging results in less inflation of diversity at habitat than at point scales; paleoecological studies should thus analyze data at multiple spatial scales, including that of the habitat where multiple bulk samples have been pooled in order to minimize time-averaging effects. The diversity of assemblages that have accumulated over 1000 years at point and habitat scales is expected to be inflated by an average of 2.1 and 1.6, respectively. This degree of inflation is slightly higher than that observed in molluscan death assemblages at these same spatial scales (1.8 and 1.3). Thus, neutral metacommunity models provide useful quantitative constraints on directional but predictable effects of time-averaging. They provide minimal estimates for the rate of increase in diversity with time-averaging because they assume no change in environmental conditions and in the composition of the metacommunity within the window of averaging.

How Area Sensitivity in Birds is Studied	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Review						area sensitivity; birds; habitat fragmentation; patch size; systematic review	CONSPECIFIC ATTRACTION; FRAGMENTED LANDSCAPES; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; GRASSLAND BIRDS; RAIN-FOREST; PATCH SIZE; CONSERVATION; REQUIREMENTS; METAANALYSIS; EDGE	Studies of avian area sensitivity have been prolific over the last 3 decades, yet general conclusions about the phenomenon are lacking. We undertook a systematic literature review to determine how widespread area sensitivity is; whether published information is biased toward certain geographic regions, habitat types, or taxonomic groups; whether the nature of area effects varies with respect to these criteria; and whether tests of area effects for individual species produce consistent results. Analysis of over 2700 area sensitivity tests, from more than 870 species, indicated the phenomenon is widespread across regions, habitats, and taxonomic groups, but that significant biases in research focus exist. North American forest habitats and Passeriformes (especially Fringillidae, Regulidae, and Paridae) are disproportionately represented in the literature. Detection of area effects was more common in tests of occurrence (47%) than in those for abundance (25%) and varied significantly among regions, habitats, and taxonomic groups. Inconsistent results for species studied multiple times and between tests of occurrence and abundance were common. These results suggest a need for future research to focus more on why area sensitivity patterns differ among studies and less on simple pattern description.

Indices quantifying the functional aspect of biodiversity are essential in understanding relationships between biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and environmental constraints. Many indices of functional diversity have been published but we lack consensus about what indices quantify, how redundant they are and which ones are recommended. 2. This study aims to build a typology of functional diversity indices from artificial data sets encompassing various community structures (different assembly rules, various species richness levels) and to identify a set of independent indices able to discriminate community assembly rules. 3. Our results confirm that indices can be divided into three main categories, each of these corresponding to one aspect of functional diversity: functional richness, functional evenness and functional divergence. Most published indices are highly correlated and quantify functional richness while quadratic entropy (Q) represents a mix between functional richness and functional divergence. Conversely, two indices (FEve and FDiv respectively quantifying functional evenness and functional divergence) are rather independent to all the others. The power analysis revealed that some indices efficiently detect assembly rules while others performed poorly. 4. To accurately assess functional diversity and establish its relationships with ecosystem functioning and environmental constraints, we recommend investigating each functional component separately with the appropriate index. Guidelines are provided to help choosing appropriate indices given the issue being investigated. 5. This study demonstrates that functional diversity indices have the potential to reveal the processes that structure biological communities. Combined with complementary methods (phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity), the multifaceted framework of functional diversity will help improve our understanding of how biodiversity interacts with ecosystem processes and environmental constraints.

Unveiling a wildlife haven: status and distribution of four Trans-Himalayan ungulates in Sikkim, India	ORYX			English	Article						Blue sheep; livestock grazing; Sikkim Trans-Himalaya; southern kiang; Tibetan argali; Tibetan gazelle	GAZELLE PROCAPRA-PICTICAUDATA; OVIS-AMMON-HODGSONI; LADAKH; CHINA; CONSERVATION; POPULATION; EXTINCTION; YENIUGOU; SHEEP	We conducted surveys in the Trans-Himalayan Tso Lhamo plateau in Sikkim, India, to ascertain the status and distribution of some of India's last surviving populations of wild ungulates (numbers in brackets are estimates for Sikkim): Tibetan argali Ovis ammon hodgsoni (c. 177 individuals), Tibetan gazelle Procapra picticaudata (c. 77), and kiang Equus kiang polyodon (c. 18). Topography appears to have an important influence on ungulate distribution, and populations of these species are aggregated in a small region along the northern boundary of the plateau. Persistence of the wild ungulates in this area can be attributed to the non-hunting tradition of local residents and to the seasonal absence of livestock (yak Bos grunniens and domestic sheep Ovis aries) and grazing. Nonetheless, wild ungulates remain vulnerable because of their small populations and anthropogenic pressure on their habitats. We recommend that conservation be prioritized in important wildlife habitats through partnerships with local communities.

Interactive effects of land use history and natural disturbance on seedling dynamics in a subtropical forest	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						disturbance; forest dynamics; Guarea guidonia; land use history; long-term ecological research; Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot, Puerto Rico; Prestoea acuminata var. montana; recruitment limitation; regeneration niche; secondary forest; succession; tropical forest	TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST; PUERTO-RICO; SECONDARY FORESTS; HURRICANE DISTURBANCE; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; TREE SEEDLINGS; WET FOREST; RECOVERY; DAMAGE; GROWTH	Human-impacted forests are increasing in extent due to widespread regrowth of secondary forests on abandoned lands. The degree and speed of recovery from human disturbance in these forests will determine their value in terms of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem function. In areas subject to periodic, severe natural disturbances, such as hurricanes, it has been hypothesized that human and natural disturbance may interact to either erase or preserve land use legacies. To increase understanding of how interactions between human and natural disturbance influence forest regeneration and recovery, we monitored seedlings in a human-and hurricane-impacted forest in northeastern Puerto Rico over a; 10-yr period and compared seedling composition and dynamics in areas that had experienced high-and low-intensity human disturbance during the first half of the 20th century. We found that land use history significantly affected the composition and diversity of the seedling layer and altered patterns of canopy openness and seedling dynamics following hurricane disturbance. The area that had been subject to high-intensity land use supported a higher density, but lower diversity, of species. In both land use history categories, the seedling layer was dominated by the same two species, Prestoea acuminata var. montana and Guarea guidonia. However, seedlings of secondary-successional species tended to be more abundant in the high-intensity land use area, while late-successional species were more abundant in the low-intensity area, consistent with patterns of adult tree distributions. Seedlings of secondary-forest species showed greater increases in growth and survival following hurricane disturbance compared to late-successional species, providing support for the hypothesis that hurricanes help preserve the signature of land use history. However, the increased performance of secondary-forest species occurred predominantly in the low-intensity land use area, suggesting that hurricanes act to homogenize differences in species composition between areas with differing land use histories by increasing secondary-forest species regeneration in areas that experienced little direct human disturbance. Our results suggest that, through effects on seedling dynamics, hurricanes may extend the signature of land use history beyond the average recovery time of forests not subject to intense natural disturbance events.

A link between plant traits and abundance: evidence from coastal California woody plants	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						abundance; California; chaparral; community assembly; photosynthesis; plant traits; specific leaf area; wood density	FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; ECONOMICS SPECTRUM; COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; CHAPARRAL SHRUBS; DISTRIBUTIONS; WORLDWIDE; WATER; DECOMPOSITION; CONVERGENCE; SUCCESSION	P>1. A number of recent studies have demonstrated that plant traits play a crucial role in determining the success or failure of species in a given environment. However, whether traits play a role in determining species' abundance and rarity among the co-occurring species within a community remains an unresolved question. 2. To address this, we analysed the abundance of California coastal woody plant species at landscape and local scales in relation to 11 leaf, wood and seed traits. 3. At the landscape scale, we found no significant relationship between traits and abundance. In contrast, at the local scale we found significant relationships between abundance and four traits: specific leaf area (SLA), height, lumen fraction and wood density. For SLA and height, the relationship was linear; for lumen fraction, it was quadratic. For wood density, the direction of the trait-abundance relationship was dependant on the abiotic context, that is, it shifted across a gradient in soil water content. 4.Synthesis. Understanding the connections between traits and abundance is important for two reasons. First, there is an ongoing debate about the degree to which commonness and rarity are the result of drift among ecologically equivalent species or niche processes. These results suggest that there are non-random, trait-based processes affecting abundance and rarity. Secondly, species' traits have been shown to have a strong effect on photosynthesis and decomposition rates, mediated by the abundance of the species. The connections between traits and abundance presented here are crucial for scaling from measurements of species' traits to ecosystem-level processes.

PANGEA: pipeline for analysis of next generation amplicons	ISME JOURNAL			English	Article						16S rRNA; high throughput sequencing; microbial ecology; bioinformatics	HUMAN GUT MICROBIOTA; DIVERSITY; SEQUENCES; BACTERIA; PROGRAM; IDENTIFICATION; BIOSPHERE; PROTEIN	High-throughput DNA sequencing can identify organisms and describe population structures in many environmental and clinical samples. Current technologies generate millions of reads in a single run, requiring extensive computational strategies to organize, analyze and interpret those sequences. A series of bioinformatics tools for high-throughput sequencing analysis, including preprocessing, clustering, database matching and classification, have been compiled into a pipeline called PANGEA. The PANGEA pipeline was written in Perl and can be run on Mac OSX, Windows or Linux. With PANGEA, sequences obtained directly from the sequencer can be processed quickly to provide the files needed for sequence identification by BLAST and for comparison of microbial communities. Two different sets of bacterial 16S rRNA sequences were used to show the efficiency of this workflow. The first set of 16S rRNA sequences is derived from various soils from Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The second set is derived from stool samples collected from diabetes-resistant and diabetes-prone rats. The workflow described here allows the investigator to quickly assess libraries of sequences on personal computers with customized databases. PANGEA is provided for users as individual scripts for each step in the process or as a single script where all processes, except the chi(2) step, are joined into one program called the 'backbone'.

J	Taylor, EB				Taylor, Eric B.			Changes in taxonomy and species distributions and their influence on estimates of faunal homogenization and differentiation in freshwater fishes	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						Biodiversity; Canada; freshwater fishes; homogenization; taxonomy; zoogeography	BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CONSERVATION PRIORITIES; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; UNITED-STATES; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; URBANIZATION; BIOGEOGRAPHY; AQUACULTURE	Aim To assess how changing taxonomy and distribution data affect estimates of faunal homogenization and differentiation as agents of global change in freshwater fishes. Location Provinces and territories of Canada. Methods Species presence-absence data were collated in 2000 and 2005 from regional and national lists, and faunal homogenization and differentiation were calculated using Jaccard's faunal similarity index. Differences between time periods and areas were summarized using principal coordinate analysis. Differences in faunal assemblages between native and total faunas were assessed via Whittaker's (1960) beta diversity (beta(w)) index and tests of differences in multivariate dispersion of fish species compositions. Results Among aquatic ecoregions in one province (British Columbia) there were four taxonomic changes and 18 distributional changes between the 2000 and 2005 databases. Pairwise Jaccard's faunal similarity index between the eight aquatic ecoregions declined by an average of 4.8% from 35.9% in native faunas to 31.1% in total faunas (introductions - extinctions/extirpations) indicating overall faunal differentiation. Average pairwise similarity declined by 0.9% between 2000 and 2005. Across thirteen provinces and territories of Canada, there were five taxonomic changes and 61 distributional changes between the 2000 and 2005 databases. Generally, faunal homogenization increased; pairwise Jaccard's increased by an average of 1.8% from 27.1% in native faunas to 28.9% in total faunas or an average of 0.6% per comparison. Main conclusions Despite changing taxonomy and fish distribution information, comparative analysis of 2000 and 2005 databases consistently show overall faunal differentiation at the smallest (provincial) spatial scale and homogenization at the largest scale (across Canada) and that these trends continued between time periods. Homogenization and differentiation followed expectations from conceptual models based on the relative prevalence of species invasions and extinctions within communities. General conclusions of the onset and extent of homogenization and differentiation were relatively insensitive to our changing understanding of taxonomy and distribution.

J	Veech, JA; Crist, TO				Veech, Joseph A.; Crist, Thomas O.			Diversity partitioning without statistical independence of alpha and beta	ECOLOGY			English	Article						additive partitioning; alpha, beta, and gamma; data simulation; diversity partitioning; multiplicative partitioning; statistical independence		Diversity partitioning has become a popular method for analyzing patterns of alpha and beta diversity. A recent evaluation of the method emphasized a distinction between additive and multiplicative partitioning and further advocated the use of multiplicative partitioning based on a presumed independence between alpha and beta. Concurrently, additive partitioning was criticized for producing dependent alpha and beta estimates. Until now, the issue of statistical independence of alpha and beta (in either type of partitioning) has not been thoroughly examined, partly due to confusion about the meaning of statistical independence. Here, we adopted a probability-based definition of statistical independence that is essentially identical to the definition found in any statistics textbook. We used a data simulation approach to show that alpha and beta diversity are not statistically independent in either additive or multiplicative partitioning. However, the extent of the dependence is not so great that it cannot be overcome by using appropriate statistical techniques to control it. Both additive and multiplicative partitioning are statistically valid and logically sound approaches to analyzing diversity patterns.

Susceptibility of Brewer Spruce (Picea breweriana) to Dwarf Mistletoes (Arceuthobium spp., Viscaceae)	NORTHWEST SCIENCE			English	Article							OREGON; CONIFERS; FIR	Brewer spruce is an endemic of the Klamath and Siskiyou Mountains in southwestern Oregon and northwestern California. Three species of dwarf mistletoes (Arceuthobium spp.) have been reported to parasitize Brewer spruce, but the susceptibility of this spruce to infection by these parasitic plants has received no attention since the late 1960s. The objective of this study is to improve estimates of the susceptibility of Brewer spruce to these parasitic plants in select areas currently supporting highly infected dominant and co-dominant trees. Three mixed conifer stands infested with one of the three dwarf mistletoes known to infect Brewer spruce (nine stands total) were sampled to evaluate the relative susceptibility of this conifer to each mistletoe species. At each of the nine study sites. 10 to 20 temporary circular plots with a 6-m radius (0.012 ha) were established around large, severely infected trees. The following data were collected for each live tree within a plot: species. diameter, and dwarf mistletoe rating. Based on the incidence of infection (% of trees >= 5 cm in diameter infected), Brewer spruce was assigned to host susceptibility classes. Based on our findings. Brewer spruce is more susceptible to dwarf mistletoe infection than previously reported. It is a principal host of both western white pine and Wiens' dwarf mistletoes, and a secondary host of mountain hemlock dwarf mistletoe. Infection of Brewer spruce was frequently severe in the nine stands we sampled, however, additional research is needed on the distribution of dwarf mistletoes on Brewer spruce and the effects these parasites have on mortality, growth, and regeneration of this rare tree.

Linking species abundance distributions in numerical abundance and biomass through simple assumptions about community structure	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						species abundance; biomass; community structure; relative abundance; species abundance distribution; guilds	DESERT RODENT COMMUNITY; FRACTAL DIMENSION; DIVIDE RESOURCES; BODY-SIZE; LANDSCAPES; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS	Species abundance distributions (SADs) are widely used as a tool for summarizing ecological communities but may have different shapes, depending on the currency used to measure species importance. We develop a simple plotting method that links SADs in the alternative currencies of numerical abundance and biomass and is underpinned by testable predictions about how organisms occupy physical space. When log numerical abundance is plotted against log biomass, the species lie within an approximately triangular region. Simple energetic and sampling constraints explain the triangular form. The dispersion of species within this triangle is the key to understanding why SADs of numerical abundance and biomass can differ. Given regular or random species dispersion, we can predict the shape of the SAD for both currencies under a variety of sampling regimes. We argue that this dispersion pattern will lie between regular and random for the following reasons. First, regular dispersion patterns will result if communities are comprised groups of organisms that use different components of the physical space (e. g. open water, the sea bed surface or rock crevices in a marine fish assemblage), and if the abundance of species in each of these spatial guilds is linked to the way individuals of varying size use the habitat. Second, temporal variation in abundance and sampling error will tend to randomize this regular pattern. Data from two intensively studied marine ecosystems offer empirical support for these predictions. Our approach also has application in environmental monitoring and the recognition of anthropogenic disturbance, which may change the shape of the triangular region by, for example, the loss of large body size top predators that occur at low abundance.

Primary succession of high-altitude Andean vegetation on lahars of Volcan Cotopaxi, Ecuador	PHYTOCOENOLOGIA			English	Article						Chronosequence; community diversity; equatorial Andes; paramo; plant growth forms; tropical alpine; volcanic disturbance.	MOUNT-ST-HELENS; PLANT SUCCESSION; LAVA FLOWS; DIVERSITY; CHRONOSEQUENCE; WASHINGTON; ATTRIBUTES; RECOVERY; TEPHRA; JAPAN	Volcanic events largely determine the species composition, structure, and dynamics of high-Andean ecosystems. We studied changes in species diversity and composition of pioneer paramo vegetation on lahars approximately 130, 250, and 475 years old on the Cotopaxi volcano. We recorded species composition and abundance of vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens in 3600 vegetation samples of the size 5x5 cm that were hierarchically arranged in larger plots. We employed non-parametric hierarchical ANOVA to quantify the effect of the lahar age on the species composition and diversity that was expressed as species richness, reciprocal of Simpson's dominance index, and equitability. We found a total of 109 species, including 33 lichens, 16 mosses, 1 liverwort, 1 gymnosperm, 44 dicotyledons, and 14 monocotyledons. Diversity is lowest on the youngest lahar, peaks in the middle-aged lahar and declines on the oldest lahar. The plant communities change from lichen-dominated towards vascular plants-dominated (mostly dicots) vegetation, lahar age accounts for about 18% of the total compositional variability. Fruticose lichens are the most abundant form on the youngest lahar, whereas foliose lichens and bryophytes peak on the middle-aged lahar, and herbs, such as cushions plants, prostrate herbs, and subshrubs, dominate on the oldest lahar. The recovery of vegetation is very slow and even after 475 years the "climax" stage of the grass paramo is not reached. It can be expected that the richness and community diversity will continue to decline as the tussock grasses become increasingly dominant.

Therefore, most biodiversity studies estimate local average or total species richness rather than local heterogeneity. Here we consider the potential for relative shifts between these different aspects of biodiversity at small spatial scales to be an early warning signal for biodiversity loss. In response to chronic, very low-level pollution, we observed a disjunctive response with gamma diversity (total species richness) and beta diversity (heterogeneity) decreasing while alpha diversity (average species richness) was still increasing. Homogenisation may, therefore, affect biodiversity through thresholds that alter the relationship between the average species richness and its heterogeneity, leading to the potential for regime shifts. Our stressor also had a strong negative effect on rare species, meaning that the purported importance of rare species as "insurance" in the face of environmental change may be overstated.

The aim of this study is to assess environmental variability in patches undergoing post-fire vegetation recovery, identifying trends of change and their relevant drivers. We particularly evaluate: the value of three spectral indices derived from Landsat satellite data [Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Wetness Component of the Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCW)] for describing secondary succession; the effectiveness of three metrics (diversity, evenness and richness) as indicators of patch variability; and how thematic resolution can affect the perception of environmental variability patterns. While the system was previously characterised as highly resilient from estimations of vegetation cover, here we noted that more time is required to fully recover pre-fire environmental variability. Using mean diversity as indicator of patch variability, we found similar patterns of temporal change for the three spectral indices (NBR, NDVI and TCW). Analogous conclusions could be drawn for richness and evenness. Patch variability, measured as diversity, showed consistent patterns across thematic resolutions, although values increased with the number of spectral classes. However, when the variance of diversity was plotted against thematic resolution, different scale dependencies were detected for those three spectral indices, yielding a dissimilar perception of patch variability. In general terms, NDVI was the best performing spectral index to assess patterns of vegetation recovery, while TCW was the worst. Finally, burned patches were classified into three classes with similar trends of change in environmental variability, which were strongly related to fire severity, elevation and vegetation type.

J	Carroll, C; Dunk, JR; Moilanen, A				Carroll, Carlos; Dunk, Jeffrey R.; Moilanen, Atte			Optimizing resiliency of reserve networks to climate change: multispecies conservation planning in the Pacific Northwest, USA	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						bioclimatic niche; connectivity; conservation prioritization; global change; spatial optimization; species distribution modeling; spotted owl; Zonation	NORTHERN SPOTTED OWL; PSEUDO-ABSENCE DATA; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; FOREST PLAN; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; SAMPLE-SIZE; OLD-GROWTH; SELECTION; PERFORMANCE; MADAGASCAR	The effectiveness of a system of reserves may be compromised under climate change as species' habitat shifts to nonreserved areas, a problem that may be compounded when well-studied vertebrate species are used as conservation umbrellas for other taxa. The Northwest Forest Plan was among the first efforts to integrate conservation of wide-ranging focal species and localized endemics into regional conservation planning. We evaluated how effectively the plan's focal species, the Northern Spotted Owl, acts as an umbrella for localized species under current and projected future climates and how the regional system of reserves can be made more resilient to climate change. We used the program maxent to develop distribution models integrating climate data with vegetation variables for the owl and 130 localized species. We used the program zonation to identify a system of areas that efficiently captures habitat for both the owl and localized species and prioritizes refugial areas of climatic and topographic heterogeneity where current and future habitat for dispersal-limited species is in proximity. We projected future species' distributions based on an ensemble of contrasting climate models, and incorporating uncertainty between alternate climate projections into the prioritization process. Reserve solutions based on the owl overlap areas of high localized-species richness but poorly capture core areas of localized species' distribution. Congruence between priority areas across taxa increases when refugial areas are prioritized. Although core-area selection strategies can potentially increase the conservation value and resilience of regional reserve systems, they accentuate contrasts in priority areas between species and over time and should be combined with a broadened taxonomic scope and increased attention to potential effects of climate change. Our results suggest that systems of fixed reserves designed for resilience can increase the likelihood of retaining the biological diversity of forest ecosystems under climate change.

Relative roles of niche and neutral processes in structuring a soil microbial community	ISME JOURNAL			English	Article						Glomeromycota; neutral theory; niche differentiation; microbial ecology; terminal fragment length polymorphisms; arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi	ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; POLYMORPHISM T-RFLP; SPECIES-ABUNDANCE; BETA DIVERSITY; AMPLIFICATION; ECOLOGY; ASSEMBLAGES; WOODLAND; DYNAMICS; ROOTS	Most attempts to identify the processes that structure natural communities have focused on conspicuous macroorganisms whereas the processes responsible for structuring microbial communities remain relatively unknown. Two main theories explaining these processes have emerged; niche theory, which highlights the importance of deterministic processes, and neutral theory, which focuses on stochastic processes. We examined whether neutral or niche-based mechanisms best explain the composition and structure of communities of a functionally important soil microbe, the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Using molecular techniques, we surveyed AM fungi from 425 individual plants of 28 plant species along a soil pH gradient. There was evidence that both niche and neutral processes structured this community. Species abundances fitted the zero-sum multinomial distribution and there was evidence of dispersal limitation, both indicators of neutral processes. However, we found stronger support that niche differentiation based on abiotic soil factors, primarily pH, was structuring the AM fungal community. Host plant species affected AM fungal community composition negligibly compared to soil pH. We conclude that although niche partitioning was the primary mechanism regulating the composition and diversity of natural AM fungal communities, these communities are also influenced by stochastic-neutral processes. This study represents one of the most comprehensive investigations of community-level processes acting on soil microbes; revealing a community that although influenced by stochastic processes, still responded in a predictable manner to a major abiotic niche axis, soil pH. The strong response to environmental factors of this community highlights the susceptibility of soil microbes to environmental change.

CHANGING FISH FAUNAS IN TWO REACHES OF THE RIO GRANDE IN THE ALBUQUERQUE BASIN	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST			English	Article							NEW-MEXICO; HYBOGNATHUS-AMARUS; SILVERY MINNOW; NORTH-AMERICA; ASSEMBLAGES; RIVER; CYPRINIDAE; DIVERSITY; SPECIMENS; PATTERNS	We intensively sampled fishes from two reaches of the Rio Grande within the Albliquerque Basin (Albuquerque and Belen valleys) during 1998-2001, compared our findings With those from 1984, and compiled it list Of all fishes known from the tow reaches. Structure of assemblages (richness, diversity, abundance distributions-taxon dominance versus rank abundance) was similar between reaches in 1998-2001, but, the faunas had low taxonomic similarity. The nonnative white sticker (Catostomus commersonii), western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), and native red shiner (Cyprinella lutrensis) dominated the Albuquerque Valley. Faunal change in the Albuquerque Valley between 1984 and 1998-2001 indicated all native fishes besides the red shiner declined, particularly the Rio Grande silvery minnow (Hybognathus amarus) and longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae). In contrast, the red shiner alone dominated the Belen Valley. nonnative fishes were less dominant, and aside from the Rio Grande silvery minnow and longnose dace, native species did not decline. Environmental differences provide it potential explanation for divergence of faunas between valleys, i.e., discharge in spring and summer is higher and substrate is coarser in die Albuquerque Valley Dewatering fragmentation by dams, and modifications of the river channel correspond to historical losses of fishes that require fluvial conditions. With the exception of the red shiner and, possibly, the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) and slender carpsucker (Carpiodes carpio) native fishes appear to be succumbing to combined stressors of change in habitat, intermittence of streamflow, and interactions with nonnative taxa.

Viral diversity and prevalence gradients in North American Pacific Coast grasslands	ECOLOGY			English	Article						alpha diversity; aphid-vectored RNA virus; barley and cereal yellow dwarf virus (B/CYDV); beta diversity; community ecology; disease ecology; Pacific coast, North America, grasslands	BARLEY-YELLOW-DWARF; WITHIN-HOST COMPETITION; INFECTIOUS-DISEASE; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; CALIFORNIA GRASSLANDS; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; REGIONAL DIVERSITY; APHID TRANSMISSION; VIRUS-INFECTION	Host pathogen interactions may be governed by the number of pathogens coexisting within an individual host (i.e., coinfection) and among different hosts, although most sampling in natural systems focuses on the prevalence of single pathogens and/or single hosts. we measured the prevalence of four barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses (B/CYDVs) in three grass species at 26 natural grasslands along a 2000-km latitudinal gradient in the western United States and Canada. B/CYDVs are aphid-vectored RNA viruses that cause one of the most prevalent of all plant diseases worldwide. Pathogen prevalence and coinfection were uncorrelated, suggesting that different forces likely drive them. Coinfection, the number of viruses in a single infected host (alpha diversity), did not differ among host species but increased roughly twofold across our latitudinal transect. This increase in coinfection corresponded with a decline in among-host pathogen turnover (beta diversity). suggesting that B/CYDVs in northern populations experience less transmission limitation than in southern populations. In contrast to pathogen diversity, pathogen prevalence was a function of host identity as well as biotic and abiotic environmental conditions. Prevalence declined with precipitation and increased with soil nitrate concentration, an important limiting nutrient for hosts and vectors of B/CYDVs. This work demonstrates the need for further studies of processes governing coinfection. and the utility of applying theory developed to explain diversity in communities of free-living organisms to pathogen systems.

Species interactions and thermal constraints on ant community structure	OIKOS			English	Article							FORAGING ACTIVITY; ABIOTIC FACTORS; PATTERNS; ECOLOGY; ASSEMBLAGES; ORGANIZATION; COMPETITION; DESERT; FIRE; COOCCURRENCE	Patterns of species occurrence and abundance are influenced by abiotic factors and biotic interactions, but these factors are difficult to disentangle without experimental manipulations. In this study, we used observational and experimental approaches to investigate the role of temperature and interspecific competition in controlling the structure of ground-foraging ant communities in forests of the Siskiyou Mountains of southwestern Oregon. To assess the potential role of competition, we first Used null model analyses to ask whether species partition temporal and/or spatial environments. TO understand how thermal tolerances influence the structure Of Communities, we conducted a laboratory experiment to estimate the maximum thermal tolerance of workers and a field experiment in which we added shaded microhabitats and monitored the response of foragers. Finally, to evaluate the roles of temperature and interspecific competition in the field, we simultaneously manipulated shading and the presence of a dominant competitor (Formica moki). The foraging activity of species broadly overlapped during the diurnal range of temperatures. Species co-occurrence patterns varied across the diurnal temperature range: species were spatially segregated at bait stations at low temperatures, but co-occurred randomly at high temperatures. The decreased abundance of the co-occurring themophilic Temnothorax nevadensis in shaded plots was a direct effect of shading and not an indirect effect of competitive interactions. Thermal tolerance predicted the response of ant species to the shading experiment: species with the lowest tolerances to high temperatures showed the greatest increase ill abundance in the shaded plots. Moreover, species with more similar thermal tolerance values segregated more frequently oil baits than did species that differed in their thermal tolerances. Collectively, our results suggest that thermal tolerances of ants may mediate competitive effects in habitats that experience strong diurnal temperature fluctuations.

ASSEMBLY RULES; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; COOCCURRENCE PATTERNS; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; DISTRIBUTIONS; COMMUNITIES; ALGORITHMS; SWAP; COMBINATIONS	A statistical challenge in community ecology is to identify segregated and aggregated pairs of species from a binary presence-absence matrix, which often contains hundreds or thousands of such potential pairs. A similar challenge is found in genomics and proteomics, where the expression of thousands of genes in microarrays must be statistically analyzed. Here we adapt the empirical Bayes method to identify statistically significant species pairs in a binary presence-absence matrix. We evaluated the performance of a simple confidence interval, a sequential Bonferroni test, and two tests based on the mean and the confidence interval of an empirical Bayes method. Observed patterns were compared to patterns generated from null model randomizations that preserved matrix row and column totals. We evaluated these four methods with random matrices and also with random matrices that had been seeded with an additional segregated or aggregated species pair. The Bayes methods and Bonferroni corrections reduced the frequency of false-positive tests (type I error) in random matrices, but did not always correctly identify the non-random pair in a seeded matrix (type II error). All of the methods were vulnerable to identifying spurious secondary associations in the seeded matrices. When applied to a set of 272 published presence-absence matrices, even the most conservative tests indicated a fourfold increase in the frequency of perfectly segregated "checkerboard" species pairs compared to the null expectation, and a greater predominance of segregated versus aggregated species pairs. The tests did not reveal a large number of significant species pairs in the Vanuatu bird matrix, but in the much smaller Galapagos bird matrix they correctly identified a concentration of segregated species pairs in the genus Geospiza. The Bayesian methods provide for increased selectivity in identifying non-random species pairs, but the analyses will be most powerful if investigators can use a priori biological criteria to identify potential sets of interacting species.

However, knowledge of its magnitude and underlying mechanisms in natural populations is biased toward short-lived taxa. This paper summarizes results of a 23-year study on a Population of the Mediterranean shrub Lavandula latifolia. We document the within-population pattern of individual variation in instantaneous and lifetime fecundity (as estimated by inflorescence production) and explore the mechanisms producing the lognormal distribution of individual fecundities by means of an individual-based simulation model. Throughout the study period, a few individuals consistently produced most inflorescences while the majority of plants exhibited moderate-to-low fecundities. The shape of yearly distributions of annual fecundities varied little across years, and most annual fecundity distributions did not depart significantly from a lognormal. The distribution of individual lifetime fecundity did not depart from lognormality. Despite the simplicity of the premises of our simulation model, it was remarkably successful at predicting the shapes of fecundity distributions and the early establishment of a persistent fecundity hierarchy. The agreement between model results and empirical data supports the view that multiplicative interactions of randomly varying environmental effects can play a central role in determining individual variation in lifetime fecundity in L. latifolia, and suggests that environmental stochasticity can be decisive in the genesis of strong fecundity hierarchies in long-lived plants.

J	Baselga, A				Baselga, Andres			Partitioning the turnover and nestedness components of beta diversity	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Beta diversity; Cerambycidae; Europe; nestedness; similarity measures; spatial turnover	SITE SIMILARITY MEASURE; PRESENCE-ABSENCE DATA; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; RICHNESS GRADIENTS; TROPICAL FORESTS; DISTANCE DECAY; DISPERSAL; PATTERNS; BEETLES; ECOLOGY	Aim Beta diversity (variation of the species composition of assemblages) may reflect two different phenomena, spatial species turnover and nestedness of assemblages, which result from two antithetic processes, namely species replacement and species loss, respectively. The aim of this paper is to provide a unified framework for the assessment of beta diversity, disentangling the contribution of spatial turnover and nestedness to beta-diversity patterns. Innovation I derive an additive partitioning of beta diversity that provides the two separate components of spatial turnover and nestedness underlying the total amount of beta diversity. I propose two families of measures of beta diversity for pairwise and multiple-site situations. Each family comprises one measure accounting for all aspects of beta diversity, which is additively decomposed into two measures accounting for the pure spatial turnover and nestedness components, respectively. Finally, I provide a case study using European longhorn beetles to exemplify the relevance of disentangling spatial turnover and nestedness patterns. Main conclusion Assigning the different beta-diversity patterns to their respective biological phenomena is essential for analysing the causality of the processes underlying biodiversity. Thus, the differentiation of the spatial turnover and nestedness components of beta diversity is crucial for our understanding of central biogeographic, ecological and conservation issues.

Demographic patterns of the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus along a latitudinal gradient, 1985-1987	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Geographic patterns; Demography; Size structure; Growth; Recruitment; Survival; Sea urchin	BAJA-CALIFORNIA PENINSULA; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; ABUNDANCE DISTRIBUTIONS; NORTHEASTERN PACIFIC; INTERTIDAL COMMUNITY; GEOGRAPHIC RANGES; MACOMA-BALTHICA; THERMAL-STRESS; CLIMATE-CHANGE	The abundant center model of geographic distribution has been tested for the purple sea urchin by others who found highest densities and reproduction towards the southern end rather than in the center of the range and so rejected the model. A question is whether size, growth, and survival data would yield other or contrary results. Intertidal densities and size structures were measured for purple sea urchins along the Pacific coast of North America during 1985-1987 from 29.93 to 50.47 degrees N, covering about 65% of the reported geographic range; these historical data were used to explore latitudinal patterns. Recruitment was based on the fractions of individuals in the smallest mode of the size distributions. Growth was determined by tagging with tetracycline and survival was estimated using size distributions and growth. Density of purple sea urchins was highest between 35 and 37 degrees N and the samples with the highest numbers of recruits occurred between 34 and 38 degrees N. Maximum diameter was largest at 43 to 44 degrees N and smallest at about 34 degrees N. There was no latitudinal pattern to growth or survival. Patterns of population traits did not fit simple models or previously published results. The interplay of coastal topography and currents are suggested as the primary determinants of density and recruitment. No general models for describing geographic distributions predict the observed patterns. The southern range limit is best explained by thermal tolerance and the northern limit by development times of larvae at low temperatures.

More than two-thirds of its surface are covered by swamp forests and mangroves, since large areas of the topographically flat island are frequently inundated, favoring vegetation tolerant to the influence of brackish and/or salt water. These wetlands provide important ecosystem services and are the habitat of some endangered and well-studied narrow endemic reptiles. From a botanical point of view, however, the swamp forests of Utila have not received much scientific attention. Using quantitative data along a line-transect, we try to provide insight into the vegetation zonation and intrazonal structures, as well as into the diversity patterns and ecotonal complexity of the swamp forests on Utila. We found an apparent zonation pattern, but edges between units differ in terms of statistically significant distinctiveness and depth, resulting in either sharp boundaries between rather discrete communities or broad ecotonal transitions affecting whole sequences along the transect. While zonation is controlled by a factorial complex of physiochemical gradients, topography, and species competition, structural features seem to be related to large-scale disturbances. The variety of functional types, structural characteristics, and evenness patterns found in Utila's coastal forests far exceed species richness in terms of diversity.

Dung deposition by cattle together with grazing and trampling can be considered as one of the important factors driving vegetation dynamics in pastures. The objective of this study was to investigate at 10-cm and 1-month resolution the plant community dynamics induced by dung deposition in two plant communities (a mesotrophic and an oligotrophic grassland) in a pasture of the Swiss Jura Mountains. Vegetation was sampled four or three times during the vegetation period in contiguous 10 cm x 10 cm quadrats from the centre of the dung pat to a distance of 60 cm. A lower grazing intensity near the dung pat was recorded for all observation periods. In the mesotrophic grassland the canopy was higher near the dung pat already one week after dung deposition. Vegetation around dung pats was submitted to two opposite fertilizing and grazing gradients, which induced changes in vegetation texture and structure at fine scale and short term. We observed a positive rank correlation between species turnover and distance to the dung for both communities, suggesting a seasonal stabilizing effect of dung on the plant composition of their direct surroundings (0-10 cm) likely due to cattle avoidance. Since dung pats are dropped every year in different locations, they create in the pasture a shifting mosaic of nutrient availability and grazing intensity inducing at seasonal scale micro-successions in plant communities.

Higher investment in defence and enhanced colonization potential may both correlate with decreased competitive ability in plants. Herbivory may thus promote coexistence of plant species exhibiting divergent life history strategies. How different seasonally tied herbivore assemblages simultaneously affect plant community composition and diversity is, however, largely unknown. Two contrasting types of herbivory can be distinguished in the aquatic vegetation of the shallow lake Lauwersmeer. In summer, predominantly above-ground tissues are eaten, whereas in winter, waterfowl forage on below-ground plant propagules. In a 4-year exclosure study we experimentally separated above-ground herbivory by waterfowl and large fish in summer from below-ground herbivory by Bewick's swans in winter. We measured the individual and combined effects of both herbivory periods on the composition of the three-species aquatic plant community. Herbivory effect sizes varied considerably from year to year. In 2 years herbivore exclusion in summer reinforced dominance of Potamogeton pectinatus with a concomitant decrease in Potamogeton pusillus, whereas no strong, unequivocal effect was observed in the other 2 years. Winter exclusion, on the other hand, had a negative effect on Zannichellia palustris, but the effect size differed considerably between years. We suggest that the colonization ability of Z. palustris may have enabled this species to be more abundant after reduction of P. pectinatus tuber densities by swans. Evenness decreased due to herbivore exclusion in summer. We conclude that seasonally tied above- and below-ground herbivory may each stimulate different components of a macrophyte community as they each favoured a different subordinate plant species.

Many of the metrics are data-intensive and require extensive effort to collect data and compute the metrics. Moreover, individual metrics do not capture all aspects of a system that are relevant to sustainability. A pilot project was initiated to create an approach to measure, monitor, and maintain prosperity and environmental quality of a regional system. The goal was to produce a straightforward, inexpensive methodology that is simple to use and interpret. This requires historical data be readily accessible, metrics must be applicable to the relevant scale, and results must meet the needs of decision-makers. Because sustainability is a multidimensional concept, the research group consisted of a multidisciplinary team that identified the major components of an environmental system. We selected metrics to capture the multidimensionality of sustainability in environmental systems and included: (1) emergy to capture the quality-normalized flow of energy through the system; (2) ecological footprint to capture the impact of humans on the system; (3) green net regional product to estimate human prosperity and well being within the system; and (4) Fisher information to capture the dynamic order of the system. We were able to compute metrics for a test geographic region using existing datasets. Preliminary analysis indicates that each metric reveals a somewhat different trend. These preliminary findings support the idea that characterization of sustainability requires a multidisciplinary approach and demonstrate the need to measure multiple aspects of an environmental system.

Each stream 100m reach was quantified for depth, flow, velocity, fish cover, percentage of pool and riffle and fish density. Highest mean velocity (0.4 m/sec.) was recorded in Thalanai stream and deeper habitats were found in Kallar stream. High species diversity was found in Achankoil stream (H'=1.15) and low species diversity was recorded in Hanumannadhi stream (H' = 0.71). The physical habitat structure (depth, current and substrate) and cover complex were evaluated by using Evenness index (H'/H'(max)). High diverse of physical habitat complex were encountered in Gugalthurai stream (E=2.8) and high value of cover complex was encountered in Sirkuli stream. Regression analysis showed that there was a significant correlation between habitat variables and fish abundance in all the sites and the cover complex values is not significantly correlated with abundance.

Influence of shelter availability on interactions between Caribbean spiny lobsters and moray eels: implications for artificial lobster enhancement	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Artificial shelters; Casitas; Competition; Environmental context; Interspecific interactions; Predation; Reef lagoon	PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS; CORAL-REEF FISH; PANULIRUS-ARGUS LATREILLE; DENSITY; HABITAT; SIZE; PATTERNS; AGGREGATION; MURAENIDAE; BEHAVIOR	The Caribbean spiny lobster Panuhrus argus is a valuable fishing resource, but local populations may be limited by availability of crevice shelter on juvenile (seagrass) habitats. This has prompted research into the potential density enhancement of juvenile lobsters with 'casitas', large (1.1 m(2) surface area) but low-lying (3.8 cm entrance height) artificial shelters that exclude large predators. Moray eels (Muraenidae), however, fit into casitas and could therefore pose a threat to lobster enhancement. In a shelter-poor reef lagoon, we examined potential interactions between juvenile lobsters and the locally dominant morays Gymnothorax vicinus and G. moringa in the absence (four 1 ha control sites) and presence of casitas (five 1 ha 'casita sites', each with 10 casitas), before (6 surveys) and after (22 surveys) deployment. Morays and lobsters did not interact as predator-prey, as morays neither consumed nor intimidated co-occurring lobsters. Rather, the 2 taxa appeared to compete for limited shelter on the reef lagoon, as suggested by a significant increase in density and mean size of both taxa on casita sites after deployment. Casitas significantly increased cohabitation of morays and lobsters, yet they tended to co-occur less often than expected by chance, but this result likely reflects behavioral differences between the highly gregarious, more numerous lobsters and the typically solitary, cannibalistic morays. Our study exemplifies the influence of habitat complexity on the nature of interspecific interactions and shows that G. vicinus and G. moringa would not pose a threat to lobster enhancement with casitas.

J	Markert, A; Wehrmann, A; Kroncke, I				Markert, Alexandra; Wehrmann, Achim; Kroencke, Ingrid			Recently established Crassostrea-reefs versus native Mytilus-beds: differences in ecosystem engineering affects the macrofaunal communities (Wadden Sea of Lower Saxony, southern German Bight)	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Bioinvasion; Biozoenosis; Crassostrea gigas; Diversity; Ecosystem engineering; Macrofauna; Mytilus edulis; Neozoa; North Sea	OYSTERCATCHERS HAEMATOPUS-OSTRALEGUS; OYSTER REEFS; DRY-WEIGHT; HABITAT; MUSSEL; EDULIS; ORGANISMS; DIVERSITY; INVASION; ANIMALS	Since 1998 the non-indigenous Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg 1793) has been invading the Wadden Sea of Lower Saxony, southern German Bight. C. gigas settles predominantly on intertidal Mytilus-beds (M. edulis L.) and subsequently create rigid reef-like structures. Both bivalve species are ecosystem engineers in sedimentary tidal flats. They provide hard substrate for sessile species, mobile organisms find refuge within the habitat matrix of dense suspension feeders, and biodeposits enrich the sediments with organic matter. The transformation of Mytilus-beds into Crassostrea-reefs gives rise to the question whether the invader may affect the native community. We investigated two parts of a changing bivalve bed in the backbarrier area of the island of Juist in March 2005. One part was still dominated by M. edulis whereas the other part was already densely colonized by C. gigas. Crassostrea-reefs compensate for the conceivable loss of Mytilus-beds in the intertidal of the Wadden Sea by replacing the ecological function of M. edulis. There was no indication of a suppression of indigenous species. This even applied to M. edulis, which persisted at the site invaded by C. gigas. The associated macrofaunal community showed increased species richness, abundance, biomass, and diversity in the Crassostrea-reef. The latter particularly favored sessile species like anthozoans, hydrozoans, and barnacles. Higher abundance and biomass for vagile epizoic species like the shore crab Carcinus maenas and the periwinkle Littorina littorea also occurred among oysters. Abundance of deposit feeding oligochaetes was enhanced by oysters as well. More opportunistic, facultative filter-feeding polychaetes occurred in the Crassostrea-reef.

With the growing number of modelling approaches available, knowledge of the relative performance of different models in the marine environment is required. Habitat suitability of 5 demersal fish taxa in Discovery Bay, south-east Australia, were modelled using 10 presence-only algorithms: BIOCLIM, DOMAIN, ENFA (distance geometric mean [GM], distance harmonic mean [HM], median [M], area-adjusted median [Ma], median + extremum [Me], area-adjusted median + extremum [Mae] and minimum distance [Min]), and MAXENT. Model performance was assessed using kappa and area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic. The influence of spatial range (area of occupancy) and environmental niches (marginality and tolerance) on modelling performance were also tested. MAXENT generally performed best, followed by ENFA-GM and -HM, DOMAIN, BIOCLIM, ENFA-M, -Min, -Ma, -Mae and -Me algorithms. Fish with clearly definable niches (i.e. high marginality) were most accurately modelled. Generally, Euclidean distance to nearest reef, HSI-b (backscatter), rugosity and maximum curvature were the most important variables in determining suitable habitat for the 5 demersal fish taxa investigated. This comparative study encourages ongoing use of presence-only approaches, particularly MAXENT, in modelling suitable habitat for demersal marine fishes.

Diet and prey preference of juvenile lemon sharks Negaprion brevirostris	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Diet; Prey preference; Size selection; Predator-prey relationship; Foraging ecology; Lemon shark	GULF-OF-MEXICO; STOMACH CONTENTS; FEEDING-HABITS; DAILY RATION; ONTOGENIC VARIATION; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; CALIFORNIA; SELECTION; SIZE; FOOD	Sharks are often regarded as opportunistic asynchronous predators that feed on the most abundant prey. In the present study, 2 populations of juvenile lemon sharks Negaprion brevirostris were investigated from Bimini, Bahamas, with well-defined home ranges facilitating the estimation of prey preference. Stomach contents were quantitatively analysed from 396 lemon sharks with data on prey species and abundance obtained from quantitative sampling of mangrove and seagrass faunal communities to elucidate preferences with respect to prey type, prey size and location. Yellowfin mojarra Gerres cinereus dominated the diet of juvenile lemon sharks (> 50 % by weight and percentage index of relative importance, %IRI), even when present in lower abundances in the environment, Preference was determined and compared using abundance, %IRI values and original weight of prey, with the latter preferred due to their close relationship with energetic intake. Juvenile lemon sharks do not feed indiscriminately, but exhibit prey preference and size selection. Juvenile lemon sharks at Bimini demonstrated a hierarchy of prey preference: parrotfish (Scaridae) > mojarra (Gerreidae) > toadfish (Batrachoididae) > filefish (Balistidae) > grunts (Haemulidae) > barracuda (Sphyraenidae). High overlap between shark diet and mangrove communities revealed the importance of mangroves to lemon sharks and their prey. Lemon sharks fed disproportionately on intermediate sized teleosts and crustaceans, with maximum prey size of nursery-bound sharks primarily limited by availability in the environment. We conclude that sharks can be highly plastic foragers, capable of selective feeding, but will switch to more opportunistic foraging when environmental conditions deteriorate.

Here we propose a network of Priority Forests for Conservation based on a synthesis of new studies and data that have become available since legislation of the Action Plan in 2001. For selection of Priority Forests We considered minimum-area requirements for some native species, representation goals for Fiji's habitats and species assemblages, key ecological processes and the practical realities of conservation areas in Fiji. Forty Priority Forests that cover 23% of Fiji's total land area and 58% of Fiji's remaining native forest were identified. The analysis confirms the majority of conservation priority areas previously identified, recommends several new areas, and supports the Government of Fiji's policy goal of protecting 40% of remaining natural forests to achieve the goals of the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan and sustain ecosystem services for Fijian communities and economies.

This paper discusses the use of Bergmann's rule, a fundamental rule of biogeography. The rule was proposed by Carl Bergmann in 1847 and was published only in German; therefore, the majority of researchers have relied on a single translation by Mayr suggesting that races from cooler climates tend to be larger in species of warm-blooded vertebrates than races of the same species living in warmer climates. That many scientists cannot go back to the original source of information because it has not been published in English has resulted in relying on others for interpretation and led to several problems, the largest of which is whether the definition of the rule should include the mechanism, which had been proposed by Bergmann. There has been a large field of research on the subject, but few tests of the mechanisms behind the observed phenomenon. We conducted a review of the literature on Bergmann's rule, and from this suggest (1) Bergmann's original rule be maintained (a direct translation is provided), (2) mechanism is inherent in Bergmann's rule and is required for a rule to be of scientific value; patterns should be labelled as trends, not rules, (3) the focus should be on falsifying hypothesized mechanisms rather than simply describing patterns, and (4) to truly evaluate Bergmann's rule in a scientific manner the original German source should be translated and made available to the scientific public.

Linking dispersal, immigration and scale in the neutral theory of biodiversity	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						Dispersal kernel; edge effects; Hubbell; immigration; scale; seed dispersal; spatially implicit and explicit neutral models; unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography	RELATIVE SPECIES ABUNDANCE; SEED DISPERSAL; TROPICAL FORESTS; MULTIPLE SAMPLES; BETA-DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; ECOLOGY; RECRUITMENT; PARAMETERS; MODELS	In the classic spatially implicit formulation of Hubbell's neutral theory of biodiversity a local community receives immigrants from a metacommunity operating on a relatively slow timescale, and dispersal into the local community is governed by an immigration parameter m. A current problem with neutral theory is that m lacks a clear biological interpretation. Here, we derive analytical expressions that relate the immigration parameter m to the geometry of the plot defining the local community and the parameters of a dispersal kernel. Our results facilitate more rigorous and extensive tests of the neutral theory: we conduct a test of neutral theory by comparing estimates of m derived from fits to empirical species abundance distributions to those derived from dispersal kernels and find acceptable correspondence; and we generate a new prediction of neutral theory by investigating how the shapes of species abundance distributions change theoretically as the spatial scale of observation changes. We also discuss how our main analytical results can be used to assess the error in the mean-field approximations associated with spatially implicit formulations of neutral theory.

Many Indian mammals face range contraction and extinction, but assessments of their population status are hindered by the lack of reliable distribution data and range maps. 2. We estimated the current geographical ranges of 20 species of large mammals by applying occupancy models to data from country-wide expert. We modelled species in relation to ecological and social covariates (protected areas, landscape characteristics and human influences) based on a priori hypotheses about plausible determinants of mammalian distribution patterns. 3. We demonstrated that failure to incorporate detection probability in distribution survey methods underestimated habitat occupancy for all species. 4. Protected areas were important for the distribution of 16 species. However, for many species much of their current range remains unprotected. The availability of evergreen forests was important for the occurrence of 14 species, temperate forests for six species, deciduous forests for 15 species and higher altitude habitats for two species. Low human population density was critical for the occurrence of five species, while culturally based tolerance was important for the occurrence of nine other species. 5. Rhino Rhinoceros unicornis, gaur Bos gaurus and elephant Elephas maximus showed the most restricted ranges among herbivores, and sun bear Helarctos malayanus, brown bear Ursus arctos and tiger Panthera tigris were most restricted among carnivores. While cultural tolerance has helped the survival of some mammals, legal protection has been critically associated with occurrence of most species. 6. Synthesis and applications. Extent of range is an important determinant of species conservation status. Understanding the relationship of species occurrence with ecological and socio-cultural covariates is important for identification and management of key conservation areas. The combination of occupancy models with field data from country-wide experts enables reliable estimation of species range and habitat associations for conservation at regional scales.

Preservation of spatial and environmental gradients by death assemblages	PALEOBIOLOGY			English	Review							SERIES UPPER ORDOVICIAN; COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; BETA-DIVERSITY; TAXONOMIC RESOLUTION; DATA TRANSFORMATIONS; STATISTICAL APPROACH; NEUTRAL THEORY; OHIO REGION; DATA SETS; NICHE	Although only a few Studies have explicitly evaluated live-dead agreement of species and community responses to environmental and spatial gradients, paleoecological analyses implicitly assume that death assemblages capture these gradients accurately. We use nine data sets from modern, relatively undisturbed coastal study areas to evaluate how the response of living molluscan assemblages to environmental gradients (water depth and seafloor type; "environmental component" of a gradient) and geographic separation ("spatial component") is captured by their death assemblages. We find that: 1. Living assemblages vary in composition either in response to environmental gradients alone (consistent with a species-sorting model) or in response to a combination of environmental and spatial gradients (mass-effect model). None of the living assemblages support the neutral model (or the patch-dynamic model), in which variation in species abundance is related to the spatial configuration of stations alone. These findings also Support assumptions that mollusk species consistently differ in responses to environmental gradients, and suggest that in the absence of postmortem bias, environmental gradients might be accurately captured by variation in species composition among death assemblages. Death assemblages L in fact respond uniquely to environmental gradients, and show a stronger response when abundances are square-root transformed to downplay the impact of numerically abundant species and increase the effect of rare species. 2. Species' niche positions (position of maximum abundance) along bathymetric and sedimentary gradients in death assemblages show significantly positive rank correlations to species positions in living assemblages in seven of nine data sets (both square-root-transformed and presence-absence data). 3. The proportion of compositional variation explained by environmental gradients in death assemblages is similar to that of counterpart living assemblages. Death assemblages thus show the same ability to capture environmental gradients as do living assemblages. In some instances compositional dissimilarities in death assemblages show higher rank correlation with spatial distances than with environmental gradients, but spatial structure in community composition is mainly driven by spatially structured environmental gradients. 4. Death assemblages correctly identify the dominance of niche metacommunity models in mollusk communities, as revealed by counterpart living assemblages. This analysis of the environmental resolution of death assemblages thus supports fine-scale niche and paleoenvironmental analyses using molluscan fossil records. In spite of taphonomic processes and time-averaging effects that modify community composition, death assemblages largely capture the response of living communities to environmental gradients, partly because of redundancy in community structure that is inherently associated with multispecies assemblages. The Molluscan data sets show some degree of redundancy as evidenced by the presence of at least two mutually exclusive subsets of species that replicate the community structure, and simple simulations show that between-sample relationships can be preserved and remain significant even when a large proportion of species is randomly removed from data sets.

What is the relation between competitive interactions and the spatial distribution of genetic variation? When spatially structured, how is the genetic differentiation among subpopulations affected by competition and size of the community? Model features and key assumptions: A model combining one-locus two-allele genetics with density-dependent regulation in population renewal (Ricker function) and demographic stochasticity is extended to incorporate S-species Lotka-Volterra competition. The system is embedded into a spatial context where 1000 populations are connected with stepping-stone dispersal. Beginning from random genotype composition, the system is simulated and the resulting community composition and genetic diversity across space are recorded. Conclusions: Genetic differentiation in the ensemble increases with the number of competing species in the community (0.30 +/- 0.13, normalized coefficient with 95% confidence limit) and with the intensity of pair-wise competition (0.20 +/- 0.05) but most strongly with their interaction (0.62 +/- 0.22). Although the system-wide differentiation increases, one finds that the process leads to local paucity of genotypes and hence a negative correlation between species diversity and local genetic diversity.

This transition is often, but not always, accompanied by the evolution of sexual dimorphism in attractive traits, and floral scent is no exception. In this review I aim to improve our understanding of variation in sexual dimorphism in floral scent characteristics by first explicating the relevant hypotheses, and then deriving explicit predictions for the pattern of floral scent from each. Next, I synthesize and qualitatively review published data on floral volatile emission rate and composition in 33 gender dimorphic species to identify emerging patterns, and evaluate these in light of predictions derived from the hypotheses. Although conclusions must be viewed as preliminary, a handful of strong patterns were revealed: (1) in the majority of the species studied males emit more volatiles per flower than females, (2) in over half of the species studied the sexes differed in at least one aspect of scent composition, (3) sexual dimorphism in scent composition was less common in species with rewardless females and/or brood site pollination than those that offered nectar and/or pollen, (4) a one-to-one correspondence between sex differences in overall scent composition and male organ-specific scent production is largely not found. This review has highlighted gaps in our understanding of the genesis of patterns of sexual dimorphism in floral scent, and makes clear that to move the field forward we need to shift our focus from pattern to process, and this will be best achieved by simultaneously testing alternative hypotheses at the same level of analysis.

NM-100% soil exhibited phytotoxic effects resulting in decreased species richness, biodiversity and biomass productivity. It also exerted impacts on several species at the cellular (production of free radicals and increased lipid peroxidation) and individual (decreased photosynthesis, growth and biomass) levels. Our results tended to prove some beneficial effects of thermal desorption treatment on plants as a recovery of vegetation was observed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The areas also differ in their cultural and socioeconomic contexts. Palm use diversity is significantly higher in the Ecuadorian Amazon than in the Yucatan Peninsula and the lower species diversity of palms in the Yucatan Peninsula is not matched by a more intensive use of the fewer species found there. The taxonomic composition of the palm flora is a poor predictor of extent of use and morphological characteristics of palm species affect usefulness only in the Ecuadorian Amazon. The Yucatecans' more limited reliance on forest products might explain the observed patterns. Ornamental palm use is an indicator of a general change in plant use patterns associated with tourism and macro-economic development in the Yucatan Peninsula. We find a positive relationship between ecosystem plant diversity and plant use diversity, but socioeconomic factors such as market integration strongly influence the use of local biodiversity. Palms represent a diverse and important natural resource that deserves further investigation to secure its sustainable management and conservation in the two studied sites, regardless of their degree of market integration.

Location Kyrgyzstan/Central Asia. Methods The study relied on a combination of predictive mapping and remote sensing. Punctual measurements of alpha diversity were linked to topography and reflectance using regression models. For beta diversity, ordination techniques were employed to extract major vegetation gradients. Scores on the ordination axes were regressed against topography as well as reflectance and subsequently mapped. Beta diversity was mapped as spatial turnover rate along these axes. Results The diversity maps quantified species counts and turnover in a spatially contiguous manner while taking into account fuzzy transitions. The variance explained by regression models ranged from 51% to 61% in cross-validation. Many of the observed differences were caused by differences in species shares. The occurrence of walnut, in particular, showed a negative relation to woody species numbers. Conclusion Mapping biodiversity in remote areas can be based on easily accessible spatial data in combination with a set of calibration field samples. With regard to human influence on walnut dominance, a total removal of human land use would be counterproductive in terms of diversity conservation. The results of this study highlight the need for comprehensive analyses of diversity patterns that include spatially contiguous quantifications of species numbers, shares and turnover rates.

We used clear cutting to experimentally manipulate upland buffer widths at 11 vernal pools in east-central Maine. Each pool was randomly assigned to one of three possible treatments: >1000-m buffer, 100-m buffer, or 30-m buffer. We radio-tracked 40 adult spotted salamanders at these pools and modeled their migratory behavior with mixed-effects regression. Mean maximum distance salamanders moved from their breeding pool was 106.0 +/- 15.4 m (range = 1.6-427.6 m). Salamanders were able to enter and cross clear cuts. We observed differences in migratory behavior between the 100-m buffer and reference treatments and between forest and clear-cut habitat; however, weather conditions and a salamander's distance from the vernal pool strongly mediated the impact of buffer treatment on migration behavior. Our findings indicate that clear cuts are semi-permeable to adult spotted salamanders, but that degree of permeability and the effects of buffer treatment largely depend on weather conditions.

J	Kembel, SW				Kembel, Steven W.			Disentangling niche and neutral influences on community assembly: assessing the performance of community phylogenetic structure tests	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						Community phylogenetic structure; dispersal; filtering; limiting similarity; metacommunity; neutral; niche; null model	NULL MODEL ANALYSIS; ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES; TRAIT EVOLUTION; CONSERVATISM; DIVERSITY; SIGNAL; OVERDISPERSION; COOCCURRENCE; BIODIVERSITY; RELATEDNESS	Patterns of phylogenetic relatedness within communities have been widely used to infer the importance of different ecological and evolutionary processes during community assembly, but little is known about the relative ability of community phylogenetics methods and null models to detect the signature of processes such as dispersal, competition and filtering under different models of trait evolution. Using a metacommunity simulation incorporating quantitative models of trait evolution and community assembly, I assessed the performance of different tests that have been used to measure community phylogenetic structure. All tests were sensitive to the relative phylogenetic signal in species metacommunity abundances and traits; methods that were most sensitive to the effects of niche-based processes on community structure were also more likely to find non-random patterns of community phylogenetic structure under dispersal assembly. When used with a null model that maintained species occurrence frequency in random communities, several metrics could detect niche-based assembly when there was strong phylogenetic signal in species traits, when multiple traits were involved in community assembly, and in the presence of environmental heterogeneity. Interpretations of the causes of community phylogenetic structure should be modified to account for the influence of dispersal.

The more you introduce the more you get: the role of colonization pressure and propagule pressure in invasion ecology	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Editorial Material						Biological invasions; colonization; null models; propagule pressure	SPECIES INVASIONS; GLOBAL PATTERNS; PLANT INVASIONS; EXOTIC BIRDS; NULL MODEL; ESTABLISHMENT; INVASIBILITY; SIMILARITY; RICHNESS; INVADERS	Aim We argue that 'propagule pressure', a key term in invasion biology, has been attributed at least three distinct definitions (with usage of a related term causing additional confusion). All of the definitions refer to fundamental concepts within the invasion process, with the result that the distinct importance of these different concepts has been at best diluted, and at worst lost. Location Global. Methods We reviewed pertinent literature on propagule pressure to resolve confusion about different uses of the term 'propagule pressure' and we introduced a new term for one variant, colonization pressure. We conducted a computer simulation whereby the introduction of species is represented as a simple sampling process to elucidate the relationship between propagule and colonization pressure. Results We defined colonization pressure as the number of species introduced or released to a single location, some of which will go on to establish a self-sustaining population and some of which will not. We subsequently argued that colonization pressure should serve as a null hypothesis for understanding temporal or spatial differences in exotic species richness, as the more species that are introduced, the more we should expect to establish. Finally, using a simple simulation, we showed that propagule pressure is related to colonization pressure, but in a non-linear manner. Main conclusion We suggest that the nature of the relationship between propagule pressure and colonization pressure, as well as the efficacy of various proxy measures of each, require more detailed exploration if invasion ecology is to continue to develop into a more predictive science.

StatFingerprints: a friendly graphical interface program for processing and analysis of microbial fingerprint profiles	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES			English	Article						diversity; ecology; fingerprint; processing; statistic	CONFORMATION POLYMORPHISM ANALYSIS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; DIVERSITY; SSCP; DYNAMICS; BACTERIA; TESTS; DGGE; SOIL	Molecular fingerprint methods are widely used to compare microbial communities in various habitats. The free program StatFingerprints can import, process, and display fingerprint profiles and perform numerous statistical analyses on them, and also estimate diversity indexes. StatFingerprints works with the free program R, providing an environment for statistical computing and graphics. No programming knowledge is required to use StatFingerprints, thanks to its friendly graphical user interface. StatFingerprints is useful for analysing the effect of a controlled factor on the microbial community and for establishing the relationships between the microbial community and the parameters of its environment. Multivariate analyses include ordination, clustering methods and hypothesis-driven tests like 50-50 multivariate analysis of variance, analysis of similarity or similarity percentage procedure and the program offers the possibility of plotting ordinations as a three-dimensional display.

To do this, the species-area relationship (SAR) is frequently used. That relationship assumes random patterns of habitat loss and species distributions. In nature, however, species distribution patterns are usually nonrandom, influenced by biotic and abiotic factors. Likewise, socioeconomic and environmental factors influence habitat loss and are not randomly distributed across landscapes. We used a recently developed SAR model that accounts for nonrandomness to predict rates of bird species loss in fragmented forests of the Panama Canal region, an area that was historically covered in forest but now has 53% forest cover. Predicted species loss was higher than that predicted by the standard SAR. Furthermore, a species loss threshold was evident when remaining forest cover declined by 25%. This level of forest cover corresponds to 40% of the historical forest cover, and our model predicts rapid species loss past that threshold. This study illustrates the importance of considering patterns of species distributions and realistic habitat loss scenarios to develop better estimates of losses in species richness. Forecasts of tropical biodiversity loss generated from simple species-area relationships may underestimate actual losses because nonrandom patterns of species distributions and habitat loss are probably not unique to the Panama Canal region.

Scale as a lurking factor: incorporating scale-dependence in experimental ecology	OIKOS			English	Article							SPECIES-AREA CURVES; SPATIAL SCALE; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; DENSITY-DEPENDENCE; PATTERNS; RICHNESS; DIVERSITY; DYNAMICS; ASSEMBLAGES; DISTURBANCE	We highlight three basic observations from which scale-dependence arises: abundance increases with area, environmental conditions vary across space, and the effect of an organism on its environment is spatially limited. From these arise first-order scale-dependence, which relates an ecological variable of interest to a measure of scale. Combining first-order relationships together, we can produce second-order scale-dependencies, which occur when the relationship between two or more variables is mediated by scale. It is these relationships that are of particular interest, as they have the potential to confound experimental results. Most ecological experiments have incorporated scale either implicitly or not at all. We suggest that an explicit consideration of scale could help resolve some long-standing debates when scale is turned from a lurking variable into a working variable. Finally, we review and evaluate four different experimental sampling designs and corresponding statistical analyses that can be used to address the effects of scale in ecological experiments.

Therefore they might play an important role in dispersal of seeds of a variety of plants. We described the diversity of seeds recovered front feces of Terrapene carolina and T. ornata and made comparisons between them. There was a moderate level of dietary overlap based upon diversity of seeds in the feces. Terrapene carolina had a significantly higher species richness of seeds in its feces than T. ornata. Additionally, we documented seeds of four plants (Celtis, Pass flora, Phytolacca americana, and Platanus occidentalis) that previously were not known to be consumed or dispersed by box turtles.

J	Fontaine, C; Thebault, E; Dajoz, I				Fontaine, Colin; Thebault, Elisa; Dajoz, Isabelle			Are insect pollinators more generalist than insect herbivores?	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						generalism; herbivory; interaction web; mutualistic; pollination; trophic	ANIMAL MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; HOST-SPECIFICITY; ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES; DIFFUSE COEVOLUTION; SPECIALIZATION; EVOLUTION; WEB; CONSEQUENCES; COMPETITION; PATHOGENS	Recent community-level studies have acknowledged that generalist species are more widespread than previously thought and highlighted their preponderant impact on community functioning and evolution. It is suggested that the type of interaction, trophic versus mutualistic, should affect species generalization level; however, no direct comparison has been made yet. Here, we performed such a comparison using 44 plant-insect networks describing either pollination or herbivory communities. Our analysis shows that the type of interaction does indeed have an impact on various aspects of species generalism, from the distribution of generalism in the community to the phylogenetic diversity of the plants with which a given insect species interacts. However, the amplitude of the observed differences depends on the aspect of species generalism studied. While the non-quantitative and quantitative measures of generalism suggest that pollinators interact with more plant species and more evenly than herbivores, phylogenetic measures clearly show that herbivores interact with plant species far more closely related to each other than pollinators. This comparative approach offers a promising perspective to better understand the functioning and evolution of multispecies assemblages by pointing out some fundamental singularities of communities depending on the type of interaction considered.

Although experimental laboratory studies have shown that within-host endosymbiont density can affect both of these factors, the existence of such effects in natural populations has not yet been documented. Using quantitative PCR, we survey the density of male-killing Wolbachia in natural populations of Drosophila innubila females from the Chiricahua Mountains of Arizona. We find that there is substantial ( 20 000-fold) variation in Wolbachia density among wild flies and that within-host Wolbachia density is positively correlated with both the efficacy of male killing and maternal transmission fidelity. Mean Wolbachia density increases three-to five-fold from early to late in the season. This pattern suggests that Wolbachia density declines with fly age, a conclusion corroborated by a laboratory study of Wolbachia density as a function of age. Finally, we suggest three alternative hypotheses to account for the approximately lognormal distribution of Wolbachia density among wild flies.

J	Harte, J; Smith, AB; Storch, D				Harte, John; Smith, Adam B.; Storch, David			Biodiversity scales from plots to biomes with a universal species-area curve	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Letter						Abundance; biodiversity; macroecology; power law; scaling; species-area relationship	TROPICAL FORESTS; MAXIMUM-ENTROPY; SPATIAL SCALES; DIVERSITY; EXTINCTION; RICHNESS; PATTERNS; MODELS	Classic theory predicts species richness scales as the quarter-power of area, yet species-area relationships (SAR) vary widely depending on habitat, taxa, and scale range. Because power-law SAR are used to predict species loss under habitat loss, and to scale species richness from plots to biomes, insight into the wide variety of observed SAR and the conditions under which power-law behavior should be observed is needed. Here we derive from the maximum entropy principle, a new procedure for upscaling species richness data from small census plots to larger areas, and test empirically, using multiple data sets, the prediction that up to an overall scale displacement, nested SAR lie along a universal curve, with average abundance per species at each scale determining the local slope of the curve. Power-law behaviour only arises in the limit of increasing average abundance, and in that limit, the slope approaches zero, not 1/4. An extrapolation of tree species richness in the Western Ghats to biome scale (60 000 km(2)) using only census data at plot scale (1/4 ha) is presented to illustrate the potential for applications of our theory.

Location Prepuna, subtropical semi-arid Andes. Methods At eight sites, we recorded the presence of herbaceous species in spaces beneath shrubs/small trees and in open areas. At the quadrat scale, the average species number per quadrat was calculated and compared between the two microhabitats (shrubs/open). At the local (site) scale, all quadrats of each site were pooled according to microhabitat, and all sites were then combined for the regional analysis. Results and conclusions We found greater herbaceous species richness below shrubs at all three spatial scales considered. Several species were found exclusively associated with the shrub undercanopy. This effect seems to depend more on greater inventory diversity at the different scales than on greater differentiation diversity in the herbaceous communities associated with shrubs. Facilitation seems to be responsible for the increase of species richness beneath shrubs, but further experimental study is needed to obtain insight into the underlying mechanisms.

Methods The proposed modification combines the classical TWINSPAN algorithm with analysis of heterogeneity of the clusters prior to each division. Four different heterogeneity measures are involved: Whittaker's beta, total inertia, average S circle divide rensen dissimilarity and average Jaccard dissimilarity. Their performance was evaluated using empirical vegetation datasets with different numbers of plots and different levels of heterogeneity. Results While the classical TWINSPAN algorithm divides each cluster coming from the previous division step, the modified algorithm divides only the most heterogeneous cluster in each step. The four tested heterogeneity measures may produce identical or very similar results. However, average Jaccard and S circle divide rensen dissimilarities may reach extreme values in clusters of small size and may produce classifications with a highly unbalanced cluster size. Conclusions The proposed modification does not alter the logic of the TWINSPAN classification, but it may change the hierarchy of divisions in the final classification. Thus, unsubstantiated divisions of homogeneous clusters are prevented, and classifications with any number of terminal clusters can be created, which increases the flexibility of TWINSPAN.

The heteroecious willow rust Melampsora larici-epitea produces five spore stages and alternates on larch (Larix). To shed light on the epidemiology of this pathogen, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) were used to determine the genetic diversity and genetic structure of rust samples collected from coppice willow (Salix) plantations at three UK sites (LA, CA and MC) over three sampling dates (September 2000, July 2001 and September 2001). Of the total of 819 isolates, 465 were unique AFLP phenotypes and there was a shift in genotype diversity between the two seasons (0.67 in 2000 and 0.87-0.89 in 2001). No phenotypes were common between the two seasons within a site, suggesting that the rust did not overwinter as an asexual stage within plantations. A temporal analysis detected large amounts of genetic drift (F(S) = 0.15-0.26) between the two seasons and very small effective population sizes (N(e) = 2-3) within sites. These results all point to a new colonization of the plantations by the rust in the second season (2001). The F(ST)-analogue values were Theta(CT) = 0.121, Weir and Cockerham's theta = 0.086 and the Bayesian estimate theta(B) = 0.087-0.096. The results suggest that the sources of inoculum were somewhat localized and the same sources were mainly responsible for disease epidemics in LA and CA over the two seasons. The relatively low F(ST)-values among sites (0.055-0.13) suggest the existence of significant gene flow among the three sampled sites.

To understand the role of introduced species in current seed-dispersal systems, we conducted fecal analyses of the most common resident land birds on the Bonin Islands, Japan, and estimated their relative importance as seed-dispersal agents. Two native birds, the brown-eared bulbul and the Bonin Islands white-eye, and the introduced Japanese white-eye were the primary seed dispersers in secondary forest sites. Because the seed species composition in the feces of native and introduced white-eyes was similar, the latter may be replacing the former as a seed-dispersal agent. Introduced plants did not decrease the number of seed-dispersal opportunities for native species through competition for seed dispersers. Because some bird species have already become extinct on the Bonin Islands, their ecological functions may also have been permanently lost; however, the introduced white-eye may be compensating for this loss of function. In addition, new mutualistic relationships involving native and introduced birds and plants have already been established. In order to control introduced species while having the least impact on the native biota, interspecific interactions must be thoroughly understood before initiating control efforts.

Rapid Seed Bank Development in Restored Tidal Freshwater Wetlands	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						non-native plants; propagules; restoration; seed bank; tidal freshwater marsh; wetlands	SALT MARSHES; VEGETATION DEVELOPMENT; PLANT COLONIZATION; PROPAGULE BANKS; DELAWARE RIVER; POTENTIAL ROLE; RESTORATION; DISPERSAL; DISTURBANCE; INUNDATION	Studies of seed bank development have rarely been included in evaluations of wetland restoration. We compared the seed bank of a recently restored tidal freshwater marsh in Washington, D.C., Kingman Marsh, with seed banks of another restored site (Kenilworth Marsh) and two reference marshes (Dueling Creek and Patuxent Marsh). The density and richness of emerging seedlings from Kingman Marsh seed bank samples increased from less than 4 seedlings and 2 taxa/90-cm(2) sample in 2000 (the year of restoration) to more than 130 seedlings and 10 taxa/90-cm(2) sample in 2003. The most important seed bank taxa at Kingman Marsh included Cyperus spp., Juncus spp., Lindernia dubia, Ludwigia palustris, and the non-native Lythrum salicaria. These taxa are not abundant in most mid-Atlantic tidal freshwater marshes but are almost identical to those described for a created tidal freshwater wetland in New Jersey. Seed banks of both the restored sites contained few seeds of several important species found at the reference sites. Flooding had a significant negative effect on emerging seedling density and taxa density, suggesting that slight decreases in soil elevation in restored wetlands will dramatically decrease recruitment from the seed bank. Because seed banks integrate processes affecting growth and reproduction of standing vegetation, we suggest that seed banks are a useful metric of wetland restoration success and urge that seed bank studies be incorporated into monitoring programs for restored wetlands.

Four plots within each of six habitats of the Ziama Biosphere Reserve were surveyed, including primary forest, secondary forest, cultivated fields, recently (less than 3 years) abandoned fields, young (10-12 years) forest restoration plots, and old (34 years) restoration plots. From August to November 2003, we pitfall-trapped 2,509 shrews representing 11 species. Shrew species richness and composition was similar in the six habitat surveyed, while shrew species abundance varied between habitats. Canopy height and cover, density of stems and trees and understorey density were shown to constitute important parameters influencing the abundance of several shrew species. After clear-cutting, restoration of key attributes of the forest vegetation structure was possible in 10-34 years, either by natural regeneration or by planting of seedlings. The relative abundance of most shrew species was similar between restoring forest (i.e., young restoration plots or fallows) and primary forest. Considering the advantages and disadvantages of these two methods of forest restoration, one of the most suitable management practices to restore forest while preserving shrew biodiversity could be to perform an alternation of native seedling plantation lines and fallows.

Elements of metacommunity structure of Paraguayan bats: multiple gradients require analysis of multiple ordination axes	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Biogeography; Boundary clumping; Coherence; Reciprocal averaging; Species composition	NULL MODEL TESTS; COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; SPECIES TURNOVER; COOCCURRENCE PATTERNS; EASTERN PARAGUAY; META-COMMUNITY; NESTEDNESS; ASSEMBLAGES; DIVERSITY; RICHNESS	Techniques to evaluate elements of metacommunity structure (EMS; coherence, species turnover and range boundary clumping) have been available for several years. Such approaches are capable of determining which idealized pattern of species distribution best describes distributions in a metacommunity. Nonetheless, this approach rarely is employed and such aspects of metacommunity structure remain poorly understood. We expanded an extant method to better investigate metacommunity structure for systems that respond to multiple environmental gradients. We used data obtained from 26 sites throughout Paraguay as a model system to demonstrate application of this methodology. Using presence-absence data for bats, we evaluated coherence, species turnover and boundary clumping to distinguish among six idealized patterns of species distribution. Analyses were conducted for all bats as well as for each of three feeding ensembles (aerial insectivores, frugivores and molossid insectivores). For each group of bats, analyses were conducted separately for primary and secondary axes of ordination as defined by reciprocal averaging. The Paraguayan bat metacommunity evinced Clementsian distributions for primary and secondary ordination axes. Patterns of species distribution for aerial insectivores were dependent on ordination axis, showing Gleasonian distributions when ordinated according to the primary axis and Clementsian distributions when ordinated according to the secondary axis. Distribution patterns for frugivores and molossid insectivores were best described as random. Analysis of metacommunities using multiple ordination axes can provide a more complete picture of environmental variables that mold patterns of species distribution. Moreover, analysis of EMS along defined gradients (e.g., latitude, elevation and depth) or based on alternative ordination techniques may complement insights based on reciprocal averaging because the fundamental questions addressed in analyses are contingent on the ordination technique that is employed.

J	Psyllakis, JM; Gillingham, MP				Psyllakis, Jennifer M.; Gillingham, Michael P.			Using forest structure and composition to predict the occurrence of vertebrate species in Douglas-Fir forests of British Columbia	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Review						Monitoring biodiversity; Surrogate measures; Species-habitat relationships	BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; HABITAT MODELS; ENVIRONMENTAL DIVERSITY; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; BOREAL FOREST; INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT; SELECTION; STRATEGY	Forest managers require an understanding of how vertebrate species respond and persist within the dynamics of changing forest environments so that management strategies can retain and recruit structural aspects necessary for the persistence of populations. Species-habitat models are often used to understand these relationships and are subsequently used to manage landscapes. We tested several species-habitat models to predict the presence or absence of a range of vertebrate species (n = 55) and to determine the potential of using vertical and horizontal measures of forest structure as a surrogate of species occurrence. We validated models with temporally and spatially independent data. Some of the models had good predictive accuracy that was retained when validated and thus have application in terms of implementation as management tools. Modelling success varied, however, depending on whether plot or stand data were used. Many models included variables related to spatial relationships of structures. Few models were reliable when applied to independent data; therefore, our results indicate that models cannot be assumed to be applicable in different years or applied outside the area where the model was developed, even with similar spatial and temporal contexts. Overall, we did not find robust relationships necessary to guide management targets for retention and recruitment of specific forest structures. Therefore, using these habitat models as surrogates for monitoring species occurrence is limited. Monitoring aspects of habitat should still be included as part of biodiversity monitoring programs because preservation of structures known to be negatively affected by harvesting (e.g., dead wood, large trees, closed canopies, continuous forests) contributes to local and landscape heterogeneity and has been shown to affect species presence in this study and others.

J	Romanuk, TN; Vogt, RJ; Kolasa, J				Romanuk, Tamara N.; Vogt, Richard J.; Kolasa, Jurek			Ecological realism and mechanisms by which diversity begets stability	OIKOS			English	Article							ROCK POOL MICROCOSMS; SPECIES RICHNESS; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; AQUATIC MICROCOSMS; STATISTICAL INEVITABILITY; INSURANCE HYPOTHESIS; ECOSYSTEM STABILITY; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; BIOMASS PRODUCTION; LIMITED RELEVANCE	We investigated how ecological realism might impact the outcome of three experimental manipulations of species richness to determine whether the patterns and the mechanisms underlying richness-variability relationships differ as ecological communities are increasingly exposed to external forces that may drive richness-variability patterns in nature. To test for such an effect, we conducted experiments using rock pool meio-invertebrate communities housed in three experimental venues: controlled laboratory microcosms, artificially constructed rock pools in the field, and naturally occurring rock pools in the field. Our results showed that experimental venue can have a strong effect on the outcome of richness manipulation experiments. As ecological realism increased, the strength of the relationship between species richness and community variability declined from 32.9% in the laboratory microcosms to 16.8% in the artificial pools to no effect of species richness on community variability in the natural rock pools. The determinants of community variability also differed as ecological realism increased. In laboratory microcosms, community variability was driven solely by mechanisms related to increasing species richness. In artificial rock pools, community variability was driven by a combination of direct and indirect environmental factors as well as mechanisms related to increasing species richness. In the natural rock pools community variability was independent of species richness and was only related to environmental factors. In summary, we found that stabilizing mechanisms associated with species interactions were influential in establishing species richness-variability relations only in the less realistic experimental venues (the laboratory microcosms and the artificial rock pools in the field), and that these mechanisms diminished in importance as ecological realism and complexity of the experimental venue increased. Our results suggest that the effects of diversity might be more difficult to detect in natural systems due to the combined effects of biotic and abiotic forcing, which can mask our ability to detect richness effects.

J	Rowe, R				Rowe, Rebecca J.			Environmental and geometric drivers of small mammal diversity along elevational gradients in Utah	ECOGRAPHY			English	Article							SPECIES-RICHNESS PATTERNS; COSTA-RICA; PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; ENDEMIC RICHNESS; GLOBAL PATTERNS; SPATIAL SCALE; CONSTRAINTS; ECOLOGY; AREA; ENERGY	The mechanisms shaping patterns of biodiversity along spatial gradients remain poorly known and controversial. Hypotheses have emphasized the importance of both environmental and spatial factors. Much of the uncertainty about the relative role of these processes can be attributed to the limited number of comparative studies that evaluate multiple potential mechanisms. This study examines the relative importance of six variables: temperature, precipitation, productivity, habitat heterogeneity, area, and the mid-domain effect on patterns of species richness for non-volant small mammals along four neighboring mountain ranges in central Utah. Along each of these elevational gradients, a hump-shaped relationship of richness with elevation is evident. This study evaluates whether the processes shaping this common pattern are also common to all gradients. Model selection indicates that no one factor or set of factors best explains patterns of species richness across all gradients, and drivers of diversity may vary seasonally. These findings suggest that commonality in the pattern of species richness, even among elevational gradients with a similar biogeographic history and fauna, cannot be attributed to a simple universal explanation.

Population viability analysis for several populations using multivariate state-space models	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Euopean Conference on Ecological Modelling	2007	Trieste, ITALY			IUCN Red List; Population viability analysis (PVA); Stochastic growth rate; Multivariate; State-space models; Restricted maximum likelihood; Measurement error; Salmon; Covariance	EXTINCTION PARAMETERS; PERSISTENCE; GROWTH; ERROR	The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), the world's largest and most important global conservation network, has listed approximately 16,000 species worldwide as threatened. The most important tool for recognizing and listing species as threatened is population viability analysis (PVA), which estimates the probability of extinction of a population or species over a specified time horizon. The most common PVA approach is to apply it to single time series of population abundance. This approach to population viability analysis ignores covariability of local populations. Covariability can be important because high synchrony of local populations reduces the effective number of local populations and leads to greater extinction risk. Needed is a way of extending PVA to model correlation structure among multiple local populations. Multivariate state-space modeling is applied to this problem and alternative estimation methods are compared. The multivariate state-space technique is applied to endangered populations of pacific salmon, USA. Simulations demonstrated that the correlation structure can strongly influence population viability and is best estimated using restricted maximum likelihood instead of maximum likelihood.

J	Hoekstra, AY				Hoekstra, A. Y.			Human appropriation of natural capital: A comparison of ecological footprint and water footprint analysis	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Ecological footprint; Water footprint; Virtual water; Consumption; Globalisation; Sustainability; Indicators; Carrying capacity	VIRTUAL WATER; TIME-SERIES; FRESH-WATER; CONSUMPTION; TRADE; PRODUCTS; SUSTAINABILITY; NETHERLANDS; RESOURCES; AUSTRIA	The water footprint concept introduced in 2002 is an analogue of the ecological footprint concept originating from the 1990s. Whereas the ecological footprint (EF) denotes the bioproductive area (hectares) needed to sustain a population, the water footprint (WF) represents the freshwater volume (cubic metres per year) required. In elaborating the WF concept into a well-defined quantifiable indicator, a number of methodological issues have been addressed, with many similarities to the methodological concerns in EF analysis. The methodology followed in WF studies is in most cases analogous to the methodology taken in EF studies, but deviates at some points. Well-reasoned it has been chosen for instance to specifically take into account the source and production circumstances of products and assess the actual water use involved, thus not taking global averages. As a result one can exactly localise the spatial distribution of a water footprint of a country. With respect to the outcome of the footprint estimates, one can see both similarities and striking differences. Food consumption for instance contributes significantly to both the EF and the WF, but mobility (and associated energy use) is very important only for the EF. From a sustainability perspective, the WF of a country tells another story and thus at times will put particular development strategies in a different perspective. The paper reviews and compares the methodologies in EF and WF studies, compares nation's footprint estimates and suggests how the two concepts can be interpreted in relation to one another. The key conclusion is that the two concepts are to be regarded as complementary in the sustainability debate. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SEASONAL TROPHIC ECOLOGY OF THE WHITE-ANKLED MOUSE, PEROMYSCUS PECTORALIS (RODENTIA: MURIDAE) IN CENTRAL TEXAS	TEXAS JOURNAL OF SCIENCE			English	Article							FOOD-HABITS; DIET; MANICULATUS; SELECTION; LEUCOPUS; COMPETITION; HERBIVORES; COLORADO	Fruits and seeds, green foliage, and animal matter composed the seasonal diets of Peromyscus pectoralis in central Texas. Based on changes in foods consumed, five distinct seasons were delineated. Trophic diversity differed among seasons, with diversity highest in summer and lowest in winter. Diets for winter and autumn were more similar; whereas, diets for winter and late spring, winter and summer, and late spring and autumn were more dissimilar. Peromyscus pectoralis in central Texas are primarily frugivorous/granivorous herbivores with omnivorous tendencies reflecting opportunistic feeding habits.

Therefore, avian diversity was studied during the spring and fall of 2005 and 2006 on farmlands in eastern Quebec, Canada. The study focused on 12-year-old windbreaks, half of which comprised shrubs that produce non-timber forest products (NTFP). The main objectives were (1) to determine whether the introduction of NTFP into windbreaks influences bird abundance, richness and diversity; (2) to verify if NTFP attract potentially detrimental birds; and (3) to determine the habitat variables that best explain the use of windbreaks by birds. Traditional windbreaks (n = 7) were composed of larches (Larix laricina (Du Roi) Koch.) alternating with ashes (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh. or Fraxinus americana L), while the windbreaks with shrubs that produce NTFP (n = 7) included American elderberries (Sambucus canadensis L.) and highbush cranberries (Viburnum trilobum Marsh.) instead of L. laricina. No difference was found in bird abundance, diversity or richness between the two types of windbreaks, except for greater richness during springtime in windbreaks without NTFP, probably due to larches providing greater tree cover. In both windbreak types, the vast majority (>94%) of the birds belonged to the non-detrimental bird class. Bird use was positively influenced by the presence of ditches along the windbreak.

J	Caprio, E; Ellena, I; Rolando, A				Caprio, Enrico; Ellena, Ivan; Rolando, Antonio			Assessing habitat/landscape predictors of bird diversity in managed deciduous forests: a seasonal and guild-based approach	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Bird diversity; Deciduous forest management; Seasonal differences; Black locust; Oak; Habitat; Landscape; Specialists; Generalists; Diversity conservation	SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION; SPECIES RICHNESS; BIOLOGICAL INTEGRITY; FRAGMENTED FORESTS; LANDSCAPE PATTERN; CONSERVATION; HABITAT; COMMUNITIES; VEGETATION; WINTER	In this study we focused on deciduous managed forests in northwest Italy and investigated relationships between bird diversity and forest descriptors both at the habitat and landscape level through a seasonal, guild-based approach. Birds were censused by point counts in randomly selected plots of 50 m radius. Each census plot was described in habitat structure terms by using the Bitterlich variable plot-radius method. Landscape metrics (both at class- and landscape-level, according to Fragstats' terminology) were measured within 500 m radius circle of each plot using an existing GIS database. We first identified specialist and generalist species according to the presence/absence of each species in relation to habitat structure measurements using generalized additive models (GAMs), then we tested for the effects of habitat and landscape variables on guild parameters (namely, bird species richness, Shannon diversity and abundance) using generalized linear models (GLMs). Our analyses showed that several habitat and landscape predictors affected bird diversity. However, in general, guild parameters relative to specialists were especially influenced by oak biomass (a habitat predictor) and oak core area (a class-level predictor) irrespective of the season, while parameters of generalists were influenced by oak core area in winter and perimeter/area ratio of oak patches in spring. Landscape-level predictors significantly affected winter bird abundance only. Results clearly showed that the retention of native oaks both at the habitat and the landscape level is the key-factor for the conservation of diversity of specialist bird species in deciduous, originally oak-dominated woods. Results also suggest that studies focusing on different periods should be preferred to mono-season surveys and that a guild-based approach should be preferred to an holistic one taking into account all species.

By setting forth standards for field records, analysis, description, peer review, and archiving, the Ecological Society of America's Vegetation Classification Panel, in collaboration with the U.S. Federal Geographic Data Committee, NatureServe, and others, seeks to advance our common understanding of vegetation and improve our capability to sustain and restore natural systems. We provide definitions for the two floristic levels of the NVC hierarchy: associations and alliances. This is followed by a description of standards for field plot records and the identification and classification of vegetation types. Procedures for review and evaluation of proposed additions and revisions of types are provided, as is a structure for data archiving and dissemination. These procedures provide a dynamic and practical way to publish new or revised descriptions of vegetation types while maintaining a current, authoritative list of types for multiple users to access and apply.

We tested whether secondary forests follow equilibrium or non-equilibrium dynamics by evaluating community reassembly over time, across different successional stages, and among multiple life stages. Based on long-term and static data from six 1-ha plots in NE Costa Rica, we show that secondary forests are undergoing reassembly of canopy tree and palm species composition through the successful recruitment of seedlings, saplings, and young trees of mature forest species. Such patterns were observed over time within sites and across successional stages. Floristic reassembly in secondary forests showed a clear convergence with mature forest community composition, supporting an equilibrium model. This resilience stems from three key factors co-occurring locally: high abundance of generalist species in the regional flora, high levels of seed dispersal, and local presence of old-growth forest remnants.

The empirical findings are biased towards the temperate zone. Abandonment of agriculture fields is less frequent in the subtropical and tropical zones where agriculture areas are, in general, expanding. But there are exceptions; a rapid rate of abandonment of agricultural fields have taken place in the arid trans-Himalayan region, due to today's globalization of economy. We analysed agriculture fields that were abandoned between 1950 and 2003 in a large u-valley in central Nepal (3400 m a.s.l.). The potential forest vegetation is dominated by Pinus wallichina and shrubs of junipers and cotoneaster species. We tested the intermediate richness hypothesis in relation to vegetation cover, soil development and whether old-field succession is convergent or divergent with species data from 242 1 m(2) plots in 5 age-classes. The main species compositional turnover expressed by Detrended Correspondence Analyses (DCA) correlated, as expected, with time after abandonment. Fields that were abandoned a long time ago are closer to forest at the periphery of the agricultural landscape. Moisture of the soil significantly increased with age of abandonment, but total vegetation cover and pH were negatively related to age. Beta diversity expressed in DCA SD-units showed an increasing trend with age of abandonment, supporting the divergence pattern in old-field succession. The reason why the succession is not converging may be due to browsing by domestic animals that prevent a closed canopy of pines and juniper to develop. There was a significant hump-shaped pattern in species richness along the temporal gradient, which agrees with the intermediate species-richness hypothesis. There was a rapid increase in species richness in plots close to the villages that were used for haymaking which increased the seed input significantly.

But there is significant confusion about what intrinsic value is and flow it could govern conservation decision making. After examining what intrinsic value is supposed to be, we argue that it cannot guide the decision making conservation requires. An adequate ethical basis for conservation must do this, and instrumental value does it best.

Such effects may be transferred to later stages without any further change (transferred effects), reinforced by a similar effect so that their importance increases (accumulative effect), or counteracted at later stages by an opposite effect (counteractive effect). We analysed the predominance of transferred, accumulative, and counteractive effects depending on (1) organization level (community, functional group, and species levels), (2) life cycle stage (seeds, seedlings, and adults), (3) grass/forb functional group (forbs versus grasses), and (4) seed mass (small-seeded species, medium-seeded species, and large-seeded species). The study was conducted in Alcala de Henares, central Spain. During one annual cycle, we counted the number of readily germinable seeds (3,909 seeds: 2,156 forbs and 1,753 grasses), emerged seedlings (2,126 seedlings: 1,238 forbs and 888 grasses), and surviving seedlings up to reproductive adult status (917 adults: 217 forbs and 700 grasses) of all species (74 species) in a factorial field experiment under three different simulated rainfall and three seasonal sheep grazing regimes in a natural Mediterranean annual plant community composed of forbs (dicotyledonous herbs) and grasses (monocotyledonous herbs). Our main results were: (1) the proportion of transferred and counteractive effects was similar between the three studied organization levels (community, functional group, and species levels); (2) we detected many more counteractive effects in the seedling stage than in the adult stage; (3) we did not find more counteractive effects in forbs versus grasses, but transferred effects were more frequent in grasses; and (4) we found more counteractive effects with decreasing seed mass and more transferred effects with increasing seed mass. Our main conclusions were that the prevalence of counteractive effects reduces the sensitivity of the whole recruitment process and enhances the relative importance of the final stage (adults). The prevalence of transferred effects makes the recruitment process more predictable and more dependent on the early stages (seeds and seedlings).

Peaks, plateaus, canyons, and craters: the complex geometry of simple mid-domain effect models	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH			English	Article						biogeography; boundary effects; doughnut; geographical range; geometric constraints; null models; spatial scale; species richness gradients; stochastic models	SPECIES RICHNESS PATTERNS; GEOGRAPHIC RANGE SIZE; LATITUDINAL GRADIENTS; NULL MODEL; ELEVATIONAL GRADIENTS; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; NEW-WORLD; DIVERSITY; CONSTRAINTS; AREA	Background: Geographic ranges, randomly located within a bounded geographical domain, produce a central hump of species richness (the mid-domain effect, MDE). The hump arises from geometric constraints on the location of ranges, especially larger ones. Questions: (1) How do patterns of species richness in one- and two-dimensional MDE models change as a function of range size? (2) How does dispersal affect these patterns? Methods: We used a spreading dye algorithm to place assemblages of species of uniform range size in one-dimensional or two-dimensional bounded domains. In some models, we allowed dispersal to introduce range discontinuity. Results: As uniform range size increases from small to medium, a flat pattern of species richness is replaced by a pair of peripheral peaks, separated by a valley (one-dimensional models), or by a cratered ring (two-dimensional models) of species richness. With large range sizes, the peaks or rings fuse to form a central plateau (one-dimensional) or a flat-topped mound (two-dimensional) of highest species richness. Adding dispersal to the two-dimensional model weakens the peripheral ring and introduces complex patterns for long-distance dispersal. Conclusions: Heterogeneous range size distributions (whether theoretical or empirical) used in most MDE models produce species richness patterns dominated by wide-ranged species, hiding complex patterns formed by small- to medium-ranged species. These patterns, which are analogous for one and two dimensions, are complicated further by long-distance dispersal and discontinuous ranges. Although geometric constraints lead to classic mid-domain effects for large-ranged species and for mixed range-size frequency distributions, small- and medium-sized ranges of a uniform size generate more complex patterns, including peaks, plateaus, canyons, and craters of species richness.

DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						Bird populations; conservation; urban ecology	BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; SPECIES RICHNESS; GREAT-BRITAIN; BRITISH BIRDS; RURAL-AREAS; URBAN; URBANIZATION; CONSERVATION	Urban environments are often characterized as supporting a few abundant, generalist species best adapted to living alongside humans, and as such, cities are seen as agents of biotic homogenization. However, there are surprisingly few descriptions of biological populations found in cities. Here, we provide the first complete citywide population estimates of birds for any UK city, and examine the conservation status of the assemblage in comparison with the country's avifauna at large. Sheffield city, central UK We surveyed birds in every 500 m x 500 m square across the 160 km(2) of the city. Using a Distance sampling protocol, we estimated bird population sizes for the city and compared these with the size of the human population. We also compared the conservation status of the city's avian population with that of birds across the UK as a whole. Aggregation of population estimates for the 77 species observed during the surveys produced a total estimate of 602,995 (95% confidence interval (CI): 404,565-942,573) breeding birds, equating to 1.18 birds per person. The size of the non-breeding population was similar at 578,603 (464,396-728,574) individuals, or 1.13 birds per person. Surveys revealed only three non-native species, but relatively few species of national conservation concern. However, some species of conservation concern achieved very high population densities within the city, and the overall density of birds was more than six times that of the nation at large. If declines in some species are to be arrested or reversed, conservation effort will need to focus much more strongly on understanding and managing urban populations, because these might buffer some species against wholesale regional population depletion, particularly where intensive agriculture in the surrounding hinterland has led to declines in bird populations at large. Such a focus will require a significant increase in the priority and resources devoted to conservation activities in urban areas.

J	Mathiasen, RL				Mathiasen, Robert L.			COMPARATIVE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF CONIFERS TO KNOBCONE PINE DWARF MISTLETOE	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						Arceuthobium siskiyouense; host susceptibility; Pinus attenuata; Pinus jeffreyi; Pinus contorta var. contorta	ARCEUTHOBIUM-CAMPYLOPODUM; BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMATICS; DOUGLAS-FIR; VISCACEAE; CALIFORNIA	Seventeen mixed conifer stands infested with knobcone pine dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium siskiyouense) were sampled to evaluate host susceptibility to this parasitic plant. Temporary circular plots (radius 6 in) were established around dominant, severely infected knobcone pines (Pinus attenuata). Within plots, species, diameter at breast height, and dwarf mistletoe rating (6-class system) were determined for each live tree taller than 1.4 m. More than 2000 trees were sampled in 140 plots. Based on the incidence of infection, tree species were assigned to host-susceptibility classes. Although Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) and shore pine (Pinus contorta var. contorta) have been classified as rare hosts of knobcone pine dwarf mistletoe, my results suggest that Jeffrey pine Should be classified as a principal host and shore pine should be classified as an occasional host. No infection was observed on western white pine (Pinus monticola), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), or incense-cedar (Calocedrus decurrens), indicating that these species should be classified as immune.

Aquatic and terrestrial drivers of dragonfly (Odonata) assemblages within and among north-temperate lakes	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Review						dragonflies; damselflies; riparian plants; habitat selection; insect behavior; vegetation structure; predator habitat; aquatic macrophytes; lakeshore development; complex life history; benthic insects	OVIPOSITION SITE SELECTION; FRESH-WATER COMMUNITY; VEGETATION STRUCTURE; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; PACHYDIPLAX-LONGIPENNIS; RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; SPECIES COMPOSITION; LARVAL DAMSELFLIES; HABITAT COMPLEXITY	The physical structure of vegetation influences diversity, interactions, movement, and thermoregulation of animals. Vegetation structure might be a good indicator of habitat requirements of generalist predators, such as dragonflies and damselflies (order Odonata), and thereby affect species diversity. Odonates use aquatic and terrestrial habitats during larval and adult life stages, respectively, but the relative importance of vegetation in these habitats is poorly understood. We compared how aquatic and riparian habitat variables affected odonate larvae from 41 sites (each 30 m in shoreline length) on 17 lakes in northern Wisconsin. We used principal components analyses to reduce multiple habitat variables to 2 lake-level axes (lake size and development, lake wetlands and predators), 2 site-level littoral axes (littoral macrophytes, littoral muckiness), and 2 site-level riparian axes (riparian structural complexity, riparian tall wetland plants). Most (61.6%) of the variance in larval species richness occurred at the site level. Density of the most abundant family, Gomphidae, was positively related to riparian tall wetland plants, whereas species richness was positively correlated with abundance of littoral macrophytes (on the basis of multiple linear regression with an information theoretic approach). Surveys in 18 paired littoral microsites in 9 lakes indicated that larvae from the clasper and sprawler behavioral guilds were most abundant in microsites with submerged macrophytes. However, predation risk, assessed by tethering larvae in patches of submerged macrophytes, did not differ between habitats with and without macrophytes. We tested whether shoreline plants affected recruitment from the adult stage by comparing adult odonate behaviors in response to 2 riparian vegetation treatments. Adult damselfly abundance was higher where we placed potted wetland plants than at manicured lawns without tall vegetation. Our results indicate that odonate larvae might be influenced by vegetation structure in both aquatic and riparian habitats and demonstrate how animals with complex life histories link aquatic and terrestrial communities.

The distribution, abundance and diversity of birds in Manila's last greenspaces	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article						Birds; Biodiversity; Conservation; Urban ecology; Greenspaces; University of the Philippines; Introduced species; Metro Manila; Philippines	URBAN; HABITAT; URBANIZATION; COMMUNITIES	Urban environments are not considered areas with conservation importance. However greenspaces in cities have been previously identified as areas with significant avian biodiversity. We investigated the distribution and diversity of birds in what are increasingly considered as Metropolitan Manila's last greenspaces; the University of the Philippines campus, military cemeteries and two government operated parks. Using species-area analysis, abundance and diversity indices, TWINSPAN ordination and logistic regression to determine important landscape features for species presence, we describe the distribution of bird communities and diversity in Metropolitan Manila. Two major bird community groupings were observed. These are the urban exploiters and the urban adaptable with the former occurring in high abundances and the latter in low abundances in greenspaces. The number of built and natural spatial entities determines abundances. Species area analysis suggests that the greenspaces are distinct habitats that preserve faunal uniqueness whereas urbanization tends to decrease diversity. These observations suggest that greenspaces harbor significant avian biodiversity as well as the presence of endemic and threatened species. As the greenspaces possess remnant wetland and wooded habitat we recommend that they be preserved and maintained by ensuring that these habitats are incorporated in any urban development plan.

The number of studies employing this broad approach has increased to the point where comparison of their results can now be used to highlight successes and deficiencies in the approach, and to detect emerging patterns in community organization. We review studies of the phylogenetic structure of communities of different major taxa and trophic levels, across different spatial and phylogenetic scales, and using different metrics and null models. Twenty-three of 39 studies (59%) find evidence for phylogenetic clustering in contemporary communities, but terrestrial and/or plant systems are heavily over-represented among published studies. Experimental investigations, although uncommon at present, hold promise for unravelling mechanisms underlying the phylogenetic community structure patterns observed in community surveys. We discuss the relationship between metrics of phylogenetic clustering and tree balance and explore the various emerging biases in taxonomy and pitfalls of scale. Finally, we look beyond one-dimensional metrics of phylogenetic structure towards multivariate descriptors that better capture the variety of ecological behaviours likely to be exhibited in communities of species with hundreds of millions of years of independent evolution.

Damage from Hurricane Hugo only temporarily slowed above-ground biomass accretion of the developing forest. Stand increases in basal area and biomass continue to be due principally to growth of the dominant overstory species, Dacryodes excelsa and Manilkara bidentata, ingrowth of which was stimulated by Hugo. The pioneer species Cecropia schreberiana filled gaps abundantly following the Hurricane and the understory tree Psychotria berteriana proliferated. Ingrowth of Prestoea montana has been greater than for all other species since 1976 and was stimulated by Hugo and Georges as well as prior hurricanes, so that by 2005 it was the most abundant species. Hurricane Hugo caused low mortality among the largest trees on the plot. As a few species have become more dominant species evenness has declined. Species richness is only slightly greater today than in 1943. Results are discussed in terms of "building" and "thinning" phases associated with mayor hurricanes. Hurricanes have stimulated the addition of species to the forest in "building years," but have maintained that richness in the intervening "thinning years", lending credence to the "intermediate disturbance hypothesis".

Effects of Karenia brevis harmful algal blooms on nearshore fish communities in southwest Florida	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						Red tide; Karenia brevis; Fishes; Community; Biodiversity; Harmful algal bloom	RED TIDE; EASTERN GULF; ECOLOGY; DINOFLAGELLATE; BREVETOXINS; ABUNDANCE; INCREASE; IMPACTS; HYPOXIA; ESTUARY	Blooms of the toxic alga Karenia brevis, commonly referred to as 'Florida red tides,' occur along Florida's west coast on a near-annual basis, causing massive fish kills. However, few quantitative data on the ecological effects of red tides on fish communities exist. We surveyed fish communities in 5 habitats within Sarasota Bay and the adjacent Gulf of Mexico during the summers of 2004 to 2007 using a purse seine. We collected contemporaneous data on fish densities, fish species composition, K. brevis cell densities, water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity. Fish density (catch per unit effort [CPUE]) and species richness were significantly lower in all habitats during red tides. Shannon-Wiener diversity indices were significantly lower in 4 of 5 habitats during red tides. Classification and regression tree analysis showed significant negative relationships between K. brevis density and non-clupeid CPUE, and between K. brevis density and species richness. Fish community structure differed significantly between red tide and non-red tide conditions. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that of all the environmental factors investigated, K brevis density had the greatest influence on community structure. Most trophic guilds were negatively associated with K brevis density, whereas the guild that included clupeids was positively associated with K brevis density. Florida's fish kill database showed that 96% of local fish kills during 2003 to 2007 occurred during red tides. We concluded that red tides caused the observed changes in fish abundance and community structure. Harmful algal blooms occur throughout the world and may play an important, yet little understood, role in regulating fish communities.

Short-term effects of prescribed fire on densities and taxonomic diversity of soil Acari were studied in fresh pine mixed forest ("Biala" forest) in the Mazovia region, Central-Eastern Poland. Three plots (size 1 m(2)) of similar soil type and vegetation were selected for prescribed burning. Soil samples of an area of 10 cm(2) and the depth of 5 cm were collected in June 2005 - one day after the burning, 60 days after the burning and 90 days after the burning. Samples were collected from within the border of the burned plots, from the border itself, as well as from the surroundings. Due to the burning, the density of Acari communities decreased from 11.5 x 10(3) ind. m(-2) recorded in the surroundings to 3.2 x 10(3) ind. m(-2) recorded in the burned plots. Values recorded within the burned plots after the fire differed significantly from those recorded on the border (P = 0.05) and in the surroundings (P = 0.0001). After 60 days, an increase in Acari abundance was observed in the burned plots (P = 0.02), becoming similar to that noted for the border of the plot and for the surroundings. After 90 days, there were no significant differences between the burned parts of the plots, their borders and the surroundings; however, generally decreased densities were observed, possibly due to the seasonal reason. The observed changes suggest the restoration of Acari community after disturbance.

Ant species richness and evenness increase along a metal pollution gradient in the Boleslaw zinc smelter area	PEDOBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Ants; Metal pollution; Diversity indices; Dominance; Community	RED WOOD ANT; GROUND BEETLES CARABIDAE; FORMICA-POLYCTENA; ACCUMULATION PATTERNS; NEMATODE COMMUNITY; CONTAMINATED SOILS; HEAVY-METALS; DIVERSITY; HYMENOPTERA; POPULATIONS	Ants are considered to be relatively resistant to metal pollution, but the effect of metal toxicity on ant communities is poorly understood. This work examined the relationship between ant species diversity and heavy metal pollution at 16 meadow and forest sites along a metal contamination gradient in a mining and smelting region near Olkusz, Poland. Menhinick's index was used to estimate species richness. Pielou's index of evenness (J), Simpson's index of diversity (D) and the slopes of rank-abundance curves were used to estimate of species evenness. Regardless of species composition differences between forest and meadow, the increase in species diversity with increasing metal. pollution was very clear in both ecosystems. The more polluted the site, the more species were detected and the more similar in relative abundance they were. Consequently, the extent to which one or a few species dominated a community decreased. This result can be explained by indirect effects of metal pollution, that is, changes in species interactions rather than by changes in abiotic conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

J	Sklenar, P				Sklenar, Petr			Presence of cushion plants increases community diversity in the high equatorial Andes	FLORA			English	Article						Ecuador; Nurse plant; Paramo; Plant community diversity; Species richness; Tropical alpine	LARETIA-ACAULIS UMBELLIFERAE; CHILEAN PATAGONIAN ANDES; AZORELLA-MONANTHA; VEGETATION; SUPERPARAMO; COMPACTA; GROWTH	Cushion plants are a common growth form in the equatorial paramo vegetation and their surfaces are often colonized by other plants. This paper analyzes the effect of the cushion plants on the community diversity at 4650 in on the eastern slope of the Iliniza volcano in Ecuador. Ninety sample plots of 1 m(2) size were located in the study area and were divided into 25 subplots in which presence and abundance of plant species was recorded. The community diversity was expressed as species richness, Simpson's diversity index, and evenness. Correlation between the cushion species and the composition of the colonists was measured with the CCA ordination analysis, correlation between the cushion cover and community diversity was measured by means of correlation analysis. Randomized species-area curves were used to compare richness of plant communities with and without the cushions. A total of 32 species were found including five cushion plants. Most species preferred to grow on the cushion surface whereas only a few species were able to colonize open ground. Species richness and Simpson's index were significantly correlated to the cushion area but no correlation was found for evenness. The cushions were usually composed of more than one species which hampered the examination of the cushion-colonist specific relationships. Nevertheless, cushions of Azorella and Arenaria seemed to provide more favorable habitat for colonization than the other cushion species. Comparison with an earlier study made on Iliniza indicates that the presence of the cushions significantly increases the richness of the plant community. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE			French	Article							GALLOTIA-GALLOTI LACERTIDAE; TROPHIC ECOLOGY; XERIC HABITAT; SPAIN	Composition and seasonal variation of the diet of the Ocellated Lizard Timon lepidus on Oleron Island (France) through scat analysis.-The diet of the Ocellated Lizard was studied by analysis of seats collected during,in annual activity cycle in the population of Oleron Island (Charente-Maritime, France). Seats were collected after tell days from April to October 2002. The study was carried out on a sample of 110 scats. We identified 927 prey items which consisted for more than 60% of insects, 20% fruit and 11% molluscs. Temporal variations consisted in 3 main periods : one at the beginning of spring (April) dominated by the consumption of Coleoptera and arachnids, the second in the middle of summer (July and August) characterized by the consumption of Ephedra fruit and Hymenoptera, and a third (May, June, September and October) which is characterized by the consumption Of Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and molluscs. The alimentary intake diversity was highest in two periods of the year (April and August-September) and low in the beginning (March), the middle (June-July) and end (October) of the activity period. Not very mobile prey such as molluscs, Coleoptera and spiders, were preferred. Diet composition is compared to a series of analyses carried out through the species distribution range. This comparison shows that insular Populations have a tendency to develop a vegetarian diet, the same as in other lizard species.

During six pelagic surveys in the Canarian archipelago, Eastern Central Atlantic, over 65,000 fishes belonging to 211 species were collected at depths between 8 and 1035 in. The mesopelagic families of the lanternfishes (Myctophidae) and the bristlemouths (Gonostomatidae) accounted for about 50% of all specimens. By multivariate classification and ordination methods four different assemblages associated with mesopelagic, epipelagic oceanic or coastal habitats could be identified. Two of these assemblages were coastal, differing in the proportion of meso- and epipelagic species. These data indicate intense horizontal migrations of mesopelagic fishes (mainly Myctophidae) into the neritic realm and increased interactions between coastal and oceanic habitats. Alpha diversity indices were higher and dominance was lower in oceanic habitats compared to the coastal realm. No marked differences among oceanographically similar areas of the entire archipelago were found. Beta diversity as a measure of similarity among sites or samples revealed variabilities between areas south of Gran Canaria and Fuerteventura islands. A considerable heterogeneity in species distribution was found off SE Fuerteventura in an area with high hydrographic variability. Therefore, both topography and hydrography are important factors influencing the distribution and abundance of pelagic fishes in this oceanic archipelago.

J	Zeleny, D				Zeleny, David			Co-occurrence based assessment of species habitat specialization is affected by the size of species pool: reply to Fridley et al. (2007)	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Letter						additive partitioning; beta diversity; Ellenberg indicator values; generalists; habitat diversity; local-regional species richness relationship; simulation; specialists; theta value; Whittaker's beta	RICHNESS; VEGETATION; SPECIALISTS; HYPOTHESIS; DIVERSITY	1. Fridley et al. (2007) introduced a technique of species habitat specialization assessment based on co-occurrence analysis of large species-plot matrixes, with a continuous metric (theta value) intended to reflect relative species niche width. 2. They used simulated data in order to demonstrate the functionality of the new method. I repeated their simulation and introduced three alternative scenarios with various patterns of species pool size along a simulated gradient. Results indicated that the co-occurrence based estimation of species niche width is dependent on the size of species pool at the position of species optima. This relationship was also revealed in an analysis of a real data set with Ellenberg indicator values as surrogates for environmental gradients. 3. I introduced a modification of the original algorithm, which corrects the effect of the species pool on the estimation of species niche width: the beta diversity measure based on additive partitioning was replaced with the multiplicative Whittaker's beta. Even after this, the method can satisfactorily recover the real pattern of species specialization only for unsaturated communities with a linear relationship between local and regional species richness. 4. Synthesis. This paper corrects the algorithm for co-occurrence based estimation of species specialization, introduced by Fridley et al. (2007), which was sensitive to the changes in species pool size along environmental gradients.

J	Beier, CM				Beier, Colin M.			Influence of Political Opposition and Compromise on Conservation Outcomes in the Tongass National Forest, Alaska	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act; conservation policy; gap analysis; temperate rainforest; Tongass National Forest; wilderness areas	STREAM PRODUCTIVITY; SALMON; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; NITROGEN; BIOLOGY; POLICY	To understand how a highly contentious policy process influenced a major conservation effort, I examined the origins, compromises, and outcomes of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (ANILCA) for the Tongass National Forest. Tongass wilderness designation was among the most controversial issues in the ANILCA debate, and it faced strong opposition from influential lawmakers, land managers, and Alaska residents. To investigate the influence of this opposition on Tongass conservation outcomes, I conducted a gap analysis of Tongass reserves and a policy analysis of the ANILCA debate and traced the influence of specific interests through the amendments, negotiations, and resulting compromises needed to enact ANILCA. Overall, I found that Tongass reserves comprise a broadly representative cross-section of ecosystems and species habitats in southeastern Alaska. Redrawn reserve boundaries, industry subsidies, and special access regulations reflected compromises to minimize the impact of wilderness conservation on mining, timber, and local stakeholder interests, respectively. Fragmentation of the Admiralty Island National Monument-the most ecologically valuable and politically controversial reserve-resulted from compromises with Alaskan Native (indigenous peoples of Alaska) corporations and timber interests. Despite language to accommodate "reasonable access" to wilderness reserves, ongoing access limitations highlight the concerns of Alaska residents that opposed ANILCA several decades ago. More broadly, the Tongass case suggests that early and ambitious conservation action may offset strong political opposition; compromises needed to establish key reserves often exacerbate development impacts in unprotected areas; and efforts to minimize social conflicts are needed to safeguard the long-term viability of conservation measures.

J	Martinez, JJI				Martinez, J. J. I.			FIREBREAKS IN PLANTED PINE FORESTS IN ISRAEL: PATCHES FOR MEDITERRANEAN BATA ANTS	VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						AFFORESTATION; ARTHROPODS; BIODIVERSITY INDEX (SHANNON); MEDITERRANEAN VEGETATION; PINUS HALEPENSIS MILL.; SIMILARITY INDEX (MORISITA-HORN)	CORRIDORS; CONSERVATION	Natural corridors or patches in mail made habitats are considered important landscape components for animal conservation managment. I tested this hypothesis in northern hills of Israel, Surveying ant nesting in three habitats: Mediterranean shrub steppe (bata), artificial planted pine stands and unmanaged firebreak bands in pine stands, newly covered with natural bata plants. For this purpose I Surveyed twice five sites in the Northern region of Israel for a total of 75 quadrats, each 80-meter square. I detected ant nests in each quadrat by digging soil at 5 cm deep, turning up stones and splitting Stumps Of hewn trees. I found 102 nests belonging to 19 ant species representing 8% of total ant species living in Israel. Ant species showed high specialization for one of the habitats: twelve species were found in only one habitat, two species in two of them and only five species in three. The Shannon Biodiversity Index was not different in each habitat; however, I found higher similarity (Morisita-Horn Index) between firebreak and bata assemblages than between those in firebreaks and pine forests, showing that bata ants found in the firebreaks appropriated habitat for nesting. Given that ant assemblages correlate with the composition of other component of invertebrate fauna, these unmanaged firebreaks should have an important place in regional conservation policy and forest management.

The Ecological Dynamics of Clade Diversification and Community Assembly	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Review						clade diversification; extinction; macroevolution; metacommunity; phylogenetic rates; speciation	PHANEROZOIC TAXONOMIC DIVERSITY; MOLECULAR PHYLOGENIES; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; RAPID RADIATION; EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS; EXTINCTION RATES; FLOWERING PLANTS; SPECIATION RATES; SEXUAL SELECTION; CICHLID FISHES	Clades diversify in an ecological context, but most macroevolutionary models do not directly encapsulate ecological mechanisms that influence speciation and extinction. A data set of 245 chordate, arthropod, mollusk, and magnoliophyte phylogenies had a majority of clades that showed rapid lineage accumulation early with a slowing more recently, whereas a small but significant minority showed accelerated lineage accumulation in their recent histories. Previous analyses have demonstrated that macroevolutionary birth-death models can replicate the pattern of slowing lineage accumulation only by a strong decrease in speciation rate with increasing species richness and extinction rate held extremely low or absent. In contrast, the metacommunity model presented here could generate the full range of patterns seen in the real phylogenies by simply manipulating the degree of ecological differentiation of new species at the time of speciation. Specifically, the metacommunity model predicts that clades showing decelerating lineage accumulation rates are those that have diversified by ecological modes of speciation, whereas clades showing accelerating lineage accumulation rates are those that have diversified primarily by modes of speciation that generate little or no ecological diversification. A number of testable predictions that integrate data from molecular systematics, community ecology, and biogeography are also discussed.

SELECTION IN HETEROGENEOUS ENVIRONMENTS MAINTAINS THE GENE ARRANGEMENT POLYMORPHISM OF DROSOPHILA PSEUDOOBSCURA	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Adaptation; chromosomal evolution; migration; selection	INVERSION POLYMORPHISM; POPULATIONS; EVOLUTION; DISTANCE; LOCUS; RECOMBINATION; MIGRATION; RATES; FLOW	Chromosomal rearrangements may play an important role in how populations adapt to a local environment. The gene arrangement polymorphism on the third chromosome of Drosophila pseudoobscura is a model system to help determine the role that inversions play in the evolution of this species. The gene arrangements are the likely target of strong selection because they form classical clines across diverse geographic habitats, they cycle in frequency over seasons, and they form stable equilibria in population cages. A numerical approach was developed to estimate the fitness sets for 15 gene arrangement karyotypes in six niches based on a model of selection-migration balance. Gene arrangement frequencies in the six different niches were able to reach a stable meta-population equilibrium that matched the observed gene arrangement frequencies when recursions used the estimated fitnesses with a variety of initial inversion frequencies. These analyses show that a complex pattern of selection is operating in the six niches to maintain the D. pseudoobscura gene arrangement polymorphism. Models of local adaptation predict that the new inversion mutations were able to invade populations because they held combinations of two to 13 local adaptation loci together.

J	Winter, M; Kuhn, I; Nentwig, W; Klotz, S				Winter, Marten; Kuehn, Ingolf; Nentwig, Wolfgang; Klotz, Stefan			Spatial aspects of trait homogenization within the German flora	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Alien plants; biotic homogenization; functional homogenization; Germany; multiple spatial scales; plant invasions; ploidy level	BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; PLANT INVASIONS; PLOIDY LEVEL; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; EXTINCTION; INVASIVENESS; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITIES; POLYPLOIDY	Biotic homogenization, the replacement of local biota by non-indigenous and locally expanding species, is among the major effects of species invasions. Almost all studies related to this topic are focused on the species level, on taxonomic homogenization. Homogenization effects on trait diversity (functional homogenization) may be very important for ecosystem functioning, but they are rarely analysed, especially not at different spatial scales within a single study. This paper aims to examine how the presence of alien species (species introduced since 1500 ad) affects the distribution of ploidy levels in the German flora at different spatial scales. Germany. We used a resampling method and the Morisita-Horn dissimilarity index to calculate dissimilarities of ploidy level within and between alien and indigenous plants at three different spatial scales in Germany: (1) the entire country as one location, (2) between grid cells, and (3) within grid cells of a lattice covering Germany. We found a significant differentiation effect within grid cells of c. 130 km(2), with alien plants increasing the variability of ploidy levels. The differentiation effect varies according to the scale used. At the coarsest scale (entire Germany), ploidy levels of alien plants tend to be more homogeneous in composition compared with those of native plants. At the intermediate scale (between grid cells), and even more pronounced at a small scale (within grid cells), ploidy levels are more heterogeneously distributed across Germany than those of native plant species. Homogenization of ploidy levels at a large scale (entire Germany) and differentiation at a small scale (within grid cells) is comparable with the patterns found in taxonomic homogenization analyses. This analysis is a first step towards understanding the impacts of plant invasions on a trait level. Differentiation and homogenization of ploidy levels might mirror the distribution of related ecological traits and therefore might have an impact on ecosystem functioning.

Macroecological patterns of spider species richness across Europe	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Review						Araneae; biodiversity; diversity gradients; environmental variables; species richness determinants	SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION; ENVIRONMENTAL DIVERSITY; LATITUDINAL GRADIENTS; ARTHROPOD DIVERSITY; GEOGRAPHIC PATTERNS; BEETLES COLEOPTERA; REGIONAL PROCESSES; RESERVE SELECTION; AREA RELATIONSHIP; PLANT DIVERSITY	We analysed the pattern of covariation of European spider species richness with various environmental variables at different scales. Four layers of perception ranging from single investigation sites to the whole European continent were selected. Species richness was determined using published data from all four scales. Correlation analyses and stepwise multiple linear regression were used to relate richness to topographic, climatic and biotic variables. Up to nine environmental variables were included in the analyses (area, latitude, elevation range, mean annual temperature, local variation in mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, mean July temperature, local variation in mean July temperature, plant species richness). At the local and at the continental scale, no significant correlations with surface area were found, whereas at the landscape and regional scale, surface area had a significant positive effect on species richness. Factors that were positively correlated with species richness at both broader scales were plant species richness, elevation range, and specific temperature variables (regional scale: local variation in mean annual, and mean July temperature; continental scale: mean July temperature). Latitude was significantly negatively correlated with the species richness at the continental scale. Multiple models for spider species richness data accounted for up to 77% of the total variance in spider species richness data. Furthermore, multiple models explained variation in plant species richness up to 79% through the variables mean July temperature and elevation range. We conclude that these first continental wide analyses grasp the overall pattern in spider species richness of Europe quite well, although some of the observed patterns are not directly causal. Climatic variables are expected to be among the most important direct factors, although other variables (e.g. elevation range, plant species richness) are important (surrogate) correlates of spider species richness.

The species-area relationship (SAR) has long been used to describe biological diversity across spatial scales. Theoretically, we can describe SARs exhaustively from patterns of species abundance and spatial distribution; where all species are equally common and randomly dispersed, SARs typically rise steeply and then decelerate when plotted on logarithmic axes, but uneven abundances and spatial aggregation lower the SAR curve. 2. In this article, we have developed a generalized model of random placement without replacement for species-occupancy data sets to separate the effects of species abundance and spatial distribution. Observed departures from the model are used to assess the relative contributions of aggregation and unequal occupancy to curve shape. We have applied it both to modelled one- and two-species cases and to plant survey data at both small (1 x 1 m) and large (10 x 10 km) spatial resolutions. 3. In modelled distributions, common species raise the SAR most strongly at fine scales, whereas increasingly rare species add to the curve at progressively coarser scales. The effect of aggregation on SAR curvature is greatest with rare species, which lower the curve at most scales, whereas commoner species do so only at fine scales. Uneven occupancies and aggregation may result in convex, concave, S-shaped or inverted S-shaped curves in log-log space. 4. In analyses of field survey data, aggregation contributed less to lowering SAR curvature than did uneven occupancies, both in small and large scale data sets. 5. Synthesis. We have thus demonstrated that SAR shape reflects the distribution of species-occupancy and spatial patterning and provide practical methods for parsing the contributions of each to biodiversity across spatial scales. Given the prevalence of gridded occupancy biodiversity data, these methods should have broad application.	[Tjorve, Even; Tjorve, Kathleen M.

J	Wang, Q; Yu, D; Li, ZQ; Wang, LG				Wang, Qiang; Yu, Dan; Li, Zhongqiang; Wang, Ligong			The Effect of Typhoons on the Diversity and Distribution Pattern of Aquatic Plants on Hainan Island, South China	BIOTROPICA			English	Article						aquatic flora; biodiversity; climate; long-distance dispersal; tropical cyclone	LONG-DISTANCE DISPERSAL; SEED DISPERSAL; SPECIES RICHNESS; NEW-ZEALAND; WATER; FOREST; WIND; BIODIVERSITY; GROWTH; HETEROGENEITY	Typhoons are an important meteorological feature of the tropical southwest Pacific. However, little is known about their effects on aquatic plants. Here, we describe the potential influence of typhoons on the diversity and distribution of aquatic plants on Hainan Island, South China. Using a combination of field survey and published data, 266 species or sub-species belonging to 115 genera in 57 families were found across typhoon impacted regions of the island. Multiple regression analysis indicated that species richness of aquatic plants was correlated with typhoon incidence rather than the area of aquatic habitat within each region. Heavy rainfall, flooding, and strong winds are likely to create suitable habitats and increase the diversity of aquatic habitats in regions frequently affected by typhoons, which may explain the higher species richness found in those regions. Beta diversity and cluster analyses showed that distinct aquatic floras occurred in regions that were impacted by different typhoon pathways. By comparing the aquatic floras of the Philippines and the typhoon-affected regions of Hainan, we suggest that typhoons have the potential to transport aquatic plants long distances, although there are a number of other potential explanations for the patterns observed in the aquatic flora of Hainan Island.

To obtain a step-less model for this variation and to use this model to evaluate the extent to which the consensus expert classification of Norway into vegetation regions can be predicted from environmental variables. To discuss the potential of step-less models for understanding natural variation at regional scales, for stratification and for predictive modelling of species distributions and land-cover types. Location The mainland of Norway. Methods Fifty-four climatic, topographical, hydrological and geological variables were recorded for grid cells with spatial resolution (grain size) of 1 x 1, 5 x 5 and 10 x 10 km, spanning the entire mainland of Norway. Principal components analyses (PCA) were used to summarize variation in three primary data matrices and three random subsets of these. Results The first four principal components explained between 75% and 85% of the variation in the data sets. All PCAs revealed four consistent environmental gradients, in order of decreasing importance: (1) regional variation (gradient) from coast to inland and from oceanic/humid to continental areas; (2) regional variation from north to south and from high to low altitudes; (3) regional variation from north to south and from inland to coast, related to solar radiation; and (4) topographic (terrain relief) variation on finer scales than (1-3). The first two PCA axes corresponded to the two bioclimatic gradients used in expert classifications of Norway into biogeographical regions: vegetation sections (from highly oceanic to slightly continental) and vegetation zones (from nemoral to alpine). Main conclusions Our PCA analyses substantiate the current view of bioclimatic regional vegetation variation in Norway, provide an explicit characterization of this variation in terms of climatic variables, and show that environmental variability can be reproduced as GIS layers in step-less models. These models have the potential to become important tools for future predictive modelling within resource management, conservation planning and biogeographical (and other ecological) research.

Impacts of selective logging on tree diversity across a rainforest landscape: the importance of spatial scale	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY			English	Article						alpha-diversity; beta-diversity; Borneo; Danum Valley; disturbance; gap dynamics; tropical rain forest; vegetation structure	LOWLAND DIPTEROCARP FOREST; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; SPECIES RICHNESS; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; NEOTROPICAL FOREST; TROPICAL FORESTS; CHANGING SCALE; DISTANCE DECAY; DANUM VALLEY; LAND-USE	Selective logging of tropical forests imposes spatial pattern on the landscape by creating a mosaic of patches affected by different intensities of disturbance. To understand the ecological impacts of selective logging it is therefore necessary to explore how patterns of tree species composition are affected by this patchy disturbance. This study examines the impacts of selective logging on species composition and spatial patterns of vegetation structure and tree diversity in Sabah, Borneo. We compare tree diversity between logged and unlogged forest at three scales: species richness within plots, species turnover among plots, and total species richness and composition of plots combined. Logging had no effect on tree diversity measured at the smallest scale. Logged forest had a greater rate of species turnover with distance, so at a large spatial scale it supported more tree species than the relatively homogeneous unlogged area. Tree species composition also differed significantly between the two types of forest, with more small dipterocarps and large pioneers in logged forest, and more large dipterocarps in unlogged forest. Our results emphasize the importance of sampling at a sufficiently large scale to represent patterns of biodiversity within tropical forest landscapes. Large areas of production forest in SE Asia are threatened with conversion to commercial crops; our findings show that selectively logged forest can retain considerable conservation value.

Assessment of hydrological alterations on wandering beetle assemblages (coleoptera : Carabidae and Tenebrionidae) in coastal wetlands of arid Mediterranean systems	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						beetle assemblages; Carabidae and Tenebrionidae assemblages; hydrological changes; Mediterranean wetlands; Mar Menor; Spain	MANAGEMENT	Changes in wandering beetle assemblages (Carabidae and Tenebrionidae) of different habitats situated in coastal wetlands of a Mediterranean and area (Mar Menor, SE Spain) were analysed in 1984,1992 and 2003 by pitfall trapping. Over two decades, the increase in irrigated lands at watershed scale led to rising water tables in the Mar Menor wetlands, which affected their beetle communities. These hydrological changes caused an increase in the carabid population, particularly in the sites most affected by flooding, where halobionts and halophiles, which were practically absent in 1984 and 1992, had become dominant by 2003. In contrast, tenebrionid assemblages simplified with time and by 2003 were dominated by one or two generalist species. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Pardo, M. Teresa; Esteve, M.

How to find a dinosaur, and the role of synonymy in biodiversity studies	PALEOBIOLOGY			English	Article							FOSSIL RECORD; DIVERSITY; TAXONOMY; NUMBERS; CURVES	Taxon discovery underlies many studies in evolutionary biology, including biodiversity and conservation biology. Synonymy has been recognized as an issue, and as many as 30-60% of named species later turn out to be invalid as a result of synonymy or other errors in taxonomic practice. This error level cannot be ignored, because users of taxon lists do not know whether their data sets are clean or riddled with erroneous taxa. A year-by-year study of a large clade, Dinosauria, comprising over 1000 taxa, reveals how systematists have worked. The group has been subject to heavy review and revision over the decades, and the error rate is about 40% at generic level and 50% at species level. The naming of new species and genera of dinosaurs is proportional to the number of people at work in the field. But the number of valid new dinosaurian taxa depends mainly on the discovery of new territory, particularly new sedimentary basins, as well as the number of paleontologists. Error rates are highest (>50%) for dinosaurs from Europe; less well studied continents show lower totals of taxa, exponential discovery curves, and lower synonymy rates. The most prolific author of new dinosaur names was Othniel Marsh, who named 80 species, closely followed by Friedrich von Hoene (71) and Edward Cope (64), but the "success rate" (proportion of dinosaurs named that are still regarded as valid) was low (0.14-0.29) for these earlier authors, and it appears to improve through time, partly a reflection of reduction in revision time, but mainly because modern workers base their new taxa on more complete specimens. If only 50% of species are valid, evolutionary biologists and conservationists must exercise care in their use of unrevised taxon lists.

The similarity and functional diversity of habitats compared for alien and native components of Mediterranean floras	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						biodiversity loss; ecological simplification; functional and taxonomic biotic homogenization; Grime's CSR strategic triangle; sample size; similarity indices	NE SPAIN; PLANTS; URBANIZATION; COMMUNITIES; BIODIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEMS; CONSEQUENCES; CONSERVATION; INVASIBILITY; RESISTANCE	Although a number of recent studies have demonstrated biotic homogenization, these have mainly focused on larger spatial scales. Homogenizing effects are equally important at finer resolutions, e.g. through increasing similarity between habitats, which may result in a simplification of ecosystem structure and function. One major cause of homogenization is the expanding ranges of alien species, although it is not clear whether they are inherently homogenizing at smaller scales. We therefore assessed whether the alien flora is less complex across habitats than the resident native flora of Mediterranean Islands. From a regional data base, we examined floristic lists for between-habitat taxonomic and functional similarity, and within-habitat functional diversity, using resampled data sets to control for sample size biases. Aliens and natives showed equivalent complexity in most respects. At the taxonomic level, between-island and between-habitat similarities were almost identical, and when ecosystem function was measured by a functional group classification system, this was also true of between-habitat similarities and within-habitat diversities. When ecosystem function was measured using Grime's CSR classification, aliens were found to be more functionally homogenous between-habitats and less functionally diverse within habitats. However, since the CSR profiles of aliens and natives differed, simplification is not inevitable due to ecological segregation of the two floras (aliens tend to be recruited to disturbed habitats rather than displacing natives). One deficiency is a lack of large scale species abundance data. A simple simulation exercise indicated that this is likely to lead to substantial overestimation of true levels of similarity, although would only influence the comparison between aliens and natives if they have different abundance distribution curves. The results indicate that alien floras are not intrinsically more simple than natives, but a higher proportion of competitive strategists among aliens may still cause small-scale homogenization as these include many strong competitors that are likely to dominate communities.

Adaptation to the most abundant host genotype in an agricultural plant-pathogen system - potato late blight	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						gene flow; genetic drift; host-pathogen (co)evolution; local adaptation; Phytophthora infestans	PHYTOPHTHORA-INFESTANS POPULATIONS; MARGINALE-MELAMPSORA-LINI; LOCAL ADAPTATION; PARASITE COEVOLUTION; PARTIAL RESISTANCE; GENETIC-VARIATION; UNITED-KINGDOM; DOWNY MILDEW; EVOLUTION; DIVERSITY	This study investigated local adaptation of Phytophthora infestans populations, the causal agent of potato late blight, to two susceptible potato cultivars, each grown for a number of years and over large areas in separate French regions. We measured aggressiveness (quantitative pathogenicity) of each pathogen population to sympatric and allopatric hosts in a reciprocal cross-inoculation experiment. There was no evidence for specific host adaptation in this pathosystem. At both local and regional scales, the distribution of aggressiveness fits a pattern of adaptation to the most common host genotype. Our observations support the theoretical predictions that large pathogen dispersal rates and genetic drift, revealed by the comparisons of the genotypic structures of the populations tested, can lead to a local adaptation pattern detectable only at a large spatial scale. The unravelling of adaptive patterns at different spatial scales can be used for a more efficient management of the disease.

The effect of space in plant-animal mutualistic networks: insights from a simulation study	OIKOS			English	Article							ASYMMETRIC SPECIALIZATION; COEVOLUTIONARY NETWORKS; CANONICAL DISTRIBUTION; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; PATTERNS; POLLINATION; NESTEDNESS; COMMONNESS; DISPERSAL; ABUNDANCE	The topology of plant-animal mutualistic networks has the potential to determine the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of interacting species. Many mechanisms have been proposed as explanations of observed network patterns; however, the fact that plant-animal interactions are inherently spatial has so far been ignored. Using a simulation model of frugivorous birds foraging in spatially explicit landscapes we evaluated how plant distribution and the scale of bird movement decisions influenced species interaction probabilities and the resulting network properties. Spatial aggregation and limited animal mobility restricted encounter probabilities, so that the distribution of animal visits per plant deviated strongly from the binomial distribution expected for a well-mixed system. Lack of mixing in turn resulted in a strong decrease in network connectance, a weak decrease in nestedness, stronger interactions, greater strength asymmetry and the unexpected presence/absence of some interactions. Our results suggest that spatial processes may contribute substantially to structure plant-animal mutualistic networks.

Quantity versus quality: Endemism and protected areas in the temperate forest of South America	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						conservation; endemism; parsimonious analysis of endemism; protected area; temperate forest of South America	BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; DISTRIBUTIONS; DISPERSAL; HOTSPOTS	Identification of biodiversity hotspots is essential to conservation strategies aimed at minimizing the possibility of losing half of the world's species in the next 50 years. The aims of the present study were: (i) to locate and designate zones of endemism in the temperate forest of South America; and (ii) to compare the distribution of these areas with the distribution of existing protected areas in this habitat type. Endemism areas were determined by using parsimonious analysis of endemism, which identified zones of endemism on the basis of sets of endemic species that were restricted to two or more study areas. We used distribution information for five unrelated taxa (ferns, trees, reptiles, birds and mammals) to provide more reliable results and patterns than would work with only a single taxon or related taxa. The northern part of this region has high endemism for all of the taxa considered in this study. We demonstrate that although the temperate forest of South America has more than 30% of its area under some type of protection, correlation between protected areas and the areas of endemism is remarkably low. In fact, less than 10% of protected areas are situated in areas that have the greatest value for conservation (i.e. high endemism). Under the current strategy, biodiversity within South America's temperate forest is in danger despite the large amount of protected area for this forest type.

Even though the concept of this ecological pattern has been well-defined, there are several metrics by which it can be quantified. We noted that current metrics do not correctly quantify two major properties of nestedness: (1) whether marginal totals (i.e. fills) differ among columns and/or among rows, and (2) whether the presences (1's) in less-filled columns and rows coincide, respectively, with those found in the more-filled columns and rows. We propose a new metric directly based on these properties and compare its behavior with that of the most used metrics, using a set of model matrices ranging from highly-nested to alternative structures in which no nestedness should be detected. We also used an empirical dataset to explore possible biases generated by the metrics as well as to evaluate correlations between metrics. We found that nestedness has been quantified by metrics that inappropriately detect this pattern, even for matrices in which there is no nestedness. In addition, the most used metrics are prone to type I statistical errors while our new metric has better statistical properties and consistently rejects a nested pattern for different types of random matrices. The analysis of the empirical data showed that two nestedness metrics, matrix temperature and the discrepancy measure, tend to overestimate the degrees of nestedness in metacommunities. We emphasize and discuss some implications of these biases for the theoretical understanding of the processes shaping species interaction networks and metacommunity structure.

Plant responses to agricultural intensification	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						Bayesian hierarchical modelling; ecological modelling; grazing; nutrients; phosphorous; plant responses; plant traits	FUNCTIONAL TYPES; SPECIES RICHNESS; GRAZING RESPONSE; HERBACEOUS VEGETATION; EASTERN AUSTRALIA; GRASSY WOODLAND; GLOBAL CHANGE; TRAITS; DISTURBANCE; GRASSLANDS	1. A large proportion of the world's land surface is extensively managed for livestock production. In areas where livestock systems are becoming more intensive, a major challenge is to predict those plant species likely to decline, persist or increase as a result of agricultural intensification. 2. Most analyses develop inferences for frequent or abundant species, or rely on intensive studies of single species. A promising approach is to identify plant traits related to disturbance to enable inference to be made about changes in plant community composition. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to analyse the response to agricultural intensification of 494 plant species of pastures and woodlands in southern Australia, and to identify how simple species' traits (life form, growth form and species origin) influence those responses. 3. The probability of occurrence of most species declined along the two intensification gradients, grazing intensity and soil phosphorous concentration, although the occurrence of a greater proportion of species was negatively correlated with soil phosphorous. Responses could be broadly predicted from both plant origin and plant traits, in particular growth form. 4. Native perennial geophytes, ferns and shrubs were most negatively affected by both gradients, while exotic annual grasses and forbs were more tolerant. Along the phosphorous gradient, 24 of the 30 most negatively affected plant species were native geophytes. Mean within-group responses masked considerable within- and between-species variation, particularly for the exotic species group which included species that responded both negatively and positively to intensification. 5. Synthesis and applications. The hierarchical model described here provides a powerful method for estimating individual plant responses and identifying how species' traits influence those responses. Plant species native to southern Australia are sensitive to grazing and phosphorous apparently due to a shared evolutionary history of low grazing intensity and low phosphorous soils. Invading exotic plants have faced strongly contrasting ecological filters, leading to a greater diversity of responses. Where grazing systems have been most intense, a small suite of exotics dominate. Maintaining native and functional plant diversity will necessitate limits being placed on intensive livestock management systems.

We argue that population genetics theory may be misapplied in light of ecological realities that, when recognized, require scrutiny of underlying evolutionary assumptions. One ecological reality is that fragment boundaries often do not represent boundaries for mating populations of trees that benefit from long-distance pollination, sometimes abetted by long-distance seed dispersal. Where fragments do not delineate populations, genetic theory of small populations does not apply. Even in spatially isolated populations, where genetic theory may eventually apply, evolutionary arguments assume that samples from fragmented populations represent trees that have had sufficient time to experience drift, inbreeding, and ultimately inbreeding depression, an unwarranted assumption where stands in fragments are living relicts of largely unrelated predisturbance populations. Genetic degradation may not be as important as ecological degradation for many decades following habitat fragmentation.

Mid-domain models generate a central peak in richness when species ranges are placed randomly within a bounded geographic area (i.e. the domain). Until now, domain limits have been described mostly in one-dimension, usually latitude or elevation, and only occasionally in two-dimensions. Here we test 1-D, 2-D and, for the first time, 3-D mid-domain models and assess the effects of geometric constraints on species richness in North American amphibian, bird, mammal and tree species. Using spatially lagged simultaneous autoregressive models, empirical richness was predicted quite well by the mid-domain predictions and the spatial autoregressive term (45-92% R(2)). However, our results show that empirical species richness peaks do deviate from those of the MDE predictions in 3 dimensions. Variation explained (R(2)) by MDE predictions generally increased with increasing mean range size of the different biotic groups (from amphibian, to tree, mammal and finally bird data), and decreased with increasing dimensions being accounted for in the models. The results suggest geometric constraints alone can explain much of the variation in species richness with elevation, specifically with respect to the larger-range taxa, birds and mammals. Our analysis addresses many of the recent methodological criticisms directed at studies testing the MDE, and our results support the hypothesis that species diversity patterns are influenced by geometric constraints.

J	Liu, XH; Li, JH				Liu, Xuehua; Li, Jihong			Scientific solutions for the functional zoning of nature reserves in China	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Ecological Modelling	AUG 28-SEP 01, 2006	Yamaguchi, JAPAN			Laoxiancheng nature reserve; functional zoning; giant panda; GIS; habitat suitability assessment; least-cost distance calculation		Reasonable zoning of the nature reserve (NR) is the key to maintain the reserve's ecological functions for sustainable development. Many zoning designs in the past years were too subjective and lack of scientific contents. The aim of this paper is to find the new approaches for NRs' functional zoning. We firstly analyzed the practical problems occurred in the functional zoning of giant panda NRs in China. Secondly, a reasonable index system to guide zoning was established for the case study area-Laoxiancheng NR. Finally two new zoning approaches were developed, which were all automatic realization methods based on spatial analysis using GIS. The habitat suitability assessment (HSA)-based approach considered both natural landscape factors and human disturbing factors. It integrated the outputs of landscape suitability assessment and human disturbance assessment with overlaying the trail density of giant pandas. The HSA zoning showed that (1) 72.2% trail locations of giant panda lied within the core zone, while all human settlements were sited inside the experimental zone; (2) the core zone contained 82.3% suitable habitat patches, while the experimental zone defined 82% human disturbed areas. The least-cost distance calculation (LCDC)-based approach described the degrees of species conservation and of landscape resistance on species. The animal's selective movement process could be reflected by the spatial variation of the least-cost distance. we classified the least-cost distance using the standard deviation and obtained three thresholds for the core, buffer and experimental zones of Laoxiancheng NR. The LCDC zoning showed that (1) the selection of three thresholds for functional zoning was the key step of this approach; (2) the different safety-level zonings can be designed by utilizing the classification of standard deviation; and the used medium safety-level zoning produced the core, buffer and experimental zones with the areas of 77.37, 22.51 and 25.25 km(2), respectively. Two zoning results demonstrated that two approaches will be useful for species conservation and NR management and can be applied and extended to the relevant nature reserves which aim at the preservation of the endangered species and their habitats. They make it possible to avoid the subjective and non-scientific zoning. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Roadless areas and biodiversity: a case study in Alabama, USA	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Alabama; fishes; herpetofauna; plants; roadless volume	KLAMATH-SISKIYOU ECOREGION; TERRESTRIAL SALAMANDERS; AMPHIBIAN MOVEMENTS; PLETHODON-CINEREUS; LANDSCAPE; ROADS; FOREST; CONSERVATION; FRAGMENTATION; EQUILIBRIUM	Roadless areas are important for biodiversity maintenance and nature conservation but remain politically controversial due to conflicting interests of conservation and development. In this study, we applied a recently developed index of roadless volume (RV) across 67 counties of Alabama, USA as a case study to examine the relationships between roadless areas and local species richness. Our results indicated that with the increase of RV across counties, both the number of total fish and exotic fish species increased, but the relationship was not significant for endemic fish species. The number of both herpetofaunal and plant species also increased with the increasing RV. For all included species, there was a significant positive correlation between species richness and RV values. The number of endangered species decreased with the increase of RV per-capita. Wildfire occurrences increased with the increase of RV. Preserving roadless areas is an important component of biodiversity conservation.

Impact of anthropogenic disturbances on beetle communities of French Mediterranean coastal dunes	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						insect; Coleoptera; tourism; trampling; urbanization; beach; pullulation	ARTHROPOD COMMUNITIES; SANDY BEACH; ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS; SURFACE-ACTIVITY; ADAPTATIONS; COLEOPTERA; DYNAMICS; ZONATION	In coastal dunes, influenced by anthropogenic activities such as tourism, it is important to determine the relative influence of environmental factors at different spatial scales to evaluate the sensitivity of local communities to disturbances. We analyzed beetle communities of 14 dunes of the French Mediterranean coast: four in the relatively preserved Camargue area, and ten in the Var department, where tourism is intensive. Beetle communities were studied three times in early spring using sand sampling. Species-environment relationships were evaluated at the regional, landscape and local scale using redundancy analysis (RDA) and variability partitioning. About 28 species were identified, of which 15 were sand-specialist species, which accounted for more than 93% of total abundance. The beetle communities of Camargue were significantly different from those of the Var department owing to the pullulation of a Tenebrionid species (Trachyscelis aphodioides Latr.) in the Var, except for one restored dune where the community was very similar to those of Camargue. Our results showed no longitudinal gradient between the two regions. Local factors (dune height, preservation and disturbance index) significantly explained most of the variation in the dominance of T. aphodioides, while some other local factors were important for other psammophilous species. This study also suggests that dune beetle communities are strongly affected on beaches intensively managed for tourism, but beetles are still abundant in much disturbed sites.

The interacting effects of herbivore exclosures and seed addition in a wet meadow	OIKOS			English	Article							PLANT DIVERSITY; GRASSLAND RESTORATION; COMPETITIVE RESPONSE; SPECIES RICHNESS; VOLE POPULATIONS; OAK SAVANNA; RECRUITMENT; LIMITATION; COMMUNITY; PRODUCTIVITY	Seed limitation may prevent successful restoration of native plant communities. Seed addition is a common restoration practice but the role of small mammals in affecting seedling recruitment is not well understood. The purpose of this investigation was to test the relative effect of seed introduction in combination with small mammal and bird exclosurcs in an Ohio wet meadow. We ask whether the ambient population of Microtus pennsylvanicus (1) alters species composition (e.g. forb/grass/sedge, invasive, non-native); (2) influences plant diversity; and (3) reduces the effect of increasing local plant richness through seed introductions. We established a 2 x 2 factorial design including a seed addition treatment (0 and 20 seed species added) and an exclosure treatment (open and fenced to exclude all mammalian and bird herbivores and granivores). Seeds from twenty native species were selected to represent a broad range of plant life forms typically found in temperate eastern North American wet meadow communities. All species were obligate or facultative wetland species with forbs, grasses and sedges represented. We found that forb species increased inside exclosures, especially ill the seed addition treatment. We also found that relative biomass of invasive species was reduced in exclosures and with seed addition. Species richness increased with seed addition; however, exclosures significantly increased species richness and diversity, particularly of those species that were experimentally introduced by, seed. Our results Support the seed limitation hypotheses. It is also evident that seed and seedling predation are important factors that can control wet meadow community composition and diversity.

Niche separation between the weasel Mustela nivalis and the stoat M-erminea in Belarus	WILDLIFE BIOLOGY			English	Article						Belarus; diel activity rhythm; diet; habitat selection; stoat; weasel	SMALL CARNIVORES; COEXISTENCE; BRITAIN; BRITISH; HABITS; DIET	We investigated three main niche components (diet composition, habitat use and diel activity rhythms) to examine how the weasel Mustela nivalis and the stoat M. erminea, both specialised predators of small rodents, could permanently coexist in Belarus. Our research was carried out in temperate forests of Belarus, in two study areas with different environmental conditions: 1) continuous dry-land forest interspersed by a variety of swampy biotopes and aquatic ecosystems (Paazerre, northern Belarus) and 2) extended wetland with large forest patches (Palesse, southern Belarus). The habitat use and diel activity rhythms of seven weasels and eight stoats were analysed by radio-tracking over about 300 km(2) in Paazerre. Snow-tracking was also applied to study habitat use by the two mustelid species. Diet composition was examined by analysing 365 weasel scats and 606 stoat scats. Our results suggest that while the weasel and stoat occur in close proximity to each other, they use different micro-habitats, are most active during different times of the day, and prey primarily on different small rodent species. Most weasels selected forest and forest edge habitats, where they predominantly preyed on smaller rodent species (bank voles Clethrionomys glareolus and Apodemus mice); stoats selected wetlands, especially open grassy marshes, and preyed more frequently on larger rodents such as water voles Arvicola terrestris and Microtus voles. Weasels were mostly diurnal and adjusted their activity to the seasonally changing length of daylight, whereas stoats were much more active in twilight and during the night.

The scale of analysis determines the spatial pattern of woody species diversity in the Mediterranean environment	PLANT ECOLOGY			English	Article						pattern matching; spatial autocorrelation; species turnover	BETA-DIVERSITY; RICHNESS; TURNOVER; HOTSPOTS; COMMUNITIES; DEPENDENCY; ABUNDANCE	We examine the spatial pattern of woody species diversity at different scales, in two sites of Mt. Holomontas in northern Greece, which falls within the transitional zone between temperate forests and Mediterranean-type ecosystems. We investigate how diversity is distributed in space and whether the perceived pattern changes with the scale of observation. We use two different metrics of diversity: species richness and species turnover. Our main finding is that the spatial pattern of diversity changes with the scale of observation or analysis. For a given scale, the pattern of species richness (alpha diversity) is negatively correlated with the pattern of species turnover (beta diversity). Species-rich areas have more species in common with their neighbors than species-poor areas. The between-scale disparity of the spatial pattern of diversity may be a general feature of ecological systems. For this to be validated, studies with different groups of species in different biomes and in different biogeographical areas are required; our study contributes to this direction providing evidence that this holds true for woody species in Mediterranean communities. Finally, we discuss how these findings might affect important issues in theoretical and applied ecology, such as identifying the environmental factors driving biodiversity.

Habitat fragmentation and genetic diversity of an endangered, migratory songbird, the golden-cheeked warbler (Dendroica chrysoparia)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						connectivity; genetic distance; habitat specialist; microsatellite; passerine; population structure	ALLELE FREQUENCY DATA; PARTIAL MANTEL TESTS; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; MICROSATELLITE DNA; FOREST BIRDS; EMPIRICAL-EVALUATION; TEMPERATE FOREST; YELLOW WARBLER; LANDSCAPE; DIFFERENTIATION	Landscape genetic approaches offer the promise of increasing our understanding of the influence of habitat features on genetic structure. We assessed the genetic diversity of the endangered golden-cheeked warbler (Dendroica chrysoparia) across their breeding range in central Texas and evaluated the role of habitat loss and fragmentation in shaping the population structure of the species. We determined genotypes across nine microsatellite loci of 109 individuals from seven sites representing the major breeding concentrations of the species. No evidence of a recent population bottleneck was found. Differences in allele frequencies were highly significant among sites. The sampled sites do not appear to represent isolated lineages requiring protection as separate management units, although the amount of current gene flow is insufficient to prevent genetic differentiation. Measures of genetic differentiation were negatively associated with habitat connectivity and the percentage of forest cover between sites, and positively associated with geographic distance and the percentage of agricultural land between sites. The northernmost site was the most genetically differentiated and was isolated from other sites by agricultural lands. Fragmentation of breeding habitat may represent barriers to dispersal of birds which would pose no barrier to movement during other activities such as migration.

Sympatric speciation in birds is rare: Insights from range data and simulations	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						speciation; allopatric; sympatric; geographic range; birds; phylogeny	SPECIES-LEVEL PHYLOGENIES; ALLOPATRIC SPECIATION; GEOGRAPHICAL PATTERN; SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; STORM-PETREL; EVOLUTION; MODES; DIVERSIFICATION; DIFFERENTIATION; POPULATIONS	Sympatric speciation is now accepted as theoretically plausible and a likely explanation for divergence in a handful of taxa, but its contribution to large-scale patterns of speciation remains contentious. A major problem is that it is difficult to differentiate between alternate scenarios of geographic speciation when species ranges have shifted substantially in the past. Previous studies have searched for a signal of the geographic mode of speciation by testing for a correlation between time since speciation and range overlap. Here we use simulations to show that the proportion of species showing zero or complete range overlap are more reliable indicators of the geography of speciation than is the correlation between time since speciation and overlap. We then apply these findings to the distributions of 291 pairs of avian sister species. Although 49% of pairs show some overlap in their ranges, our simulations show that this is not surprising under allopatric models of speciation. More revealingly, less than 2% show complete range overlap. Our simulations demonstrate that the observed patterns are most consistent with a model in which allopatric speciation is dominant but in which sympatric speciation is also present and contributes 5% of speciation events.

J	Baselga, A				Baselga, Andres			Determinants of species richness, endemism and turnover in European longhorn beetles	ECOGRAPHY			English	Article							LATITUDINAL DIVERSITY GRADIENT; MEASURING BETA-DIVERSITY; PRESENCE-ABSENCE DATA; DISTANCE DECAY; ENERGY; PATTERNS; SCALE; WATER; CLIMATE; COLEOPTERA	This study assessed the diversity patterns of a large family of beetles, Cerambycidae, in Europe and tested the following hypotheses: 1) richness gradients of this hyperdiverse taxon are driven by water and energy variables; 2) endemism is explained by the same factors, but variation between areas also reflects post-glacial re-colonization processes; and 3) faunal composition is determined by the same climatic variables and, therefore, beta diversity (species turnover) is related to richness gradients. Species richness, endemism and beta diversity were modelled using inventories of 37 European territories, built from a database containing the distributions of 609 species. Area, spatial position, and nine topographical and climatic variables were used as predictors in regression and constrained analysis of principal coordinates modelling. Species richness was mostly explained by a temperature gradient, which produced a south-to-north decreasing richness gradient. Endemism followed the same pattern, but was also determined by longitudinal variation, peaking in the southwestern and southeastern corners of the continent. Faunal turnover was explained by an important purely spatial pattern and a spatially structured environmental gradient. Thus, contrary to other groups, cerambycid richness was mostly explained by environmental energy, but not by water availability. Endemism was concentrated in the Iberian and Greek peninsulas, but not in Italy. Thus, the latter area may have been the major source of post-glacial re-colonization for European longhorn beetles or, otherwise, a poor refuge during glaciations. Turnover patterns were independent of the richness gradient, because northern faunas are nested in southern ones. Turnover, in contrast to richness, was driven by both the independent effects of climate and geographic constraints that might reflect dispersal limitation or stochastic colonization events, suggesting that richness gradients are more environmentally deterministic phenomena than turnover patterns.

Cactus species turnover and diversity along a latitudinal transect in the Chihuahuan Desert Region	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						beta diversity; Cactaceae; Chihuahuan Desert; Mexico; Texas	BETA-DIVERSITY; ENDANGERED CACTI; CONSERVATION; CACTACEAE	A standardized sampling method was used to evaluate turnover (beta diversity) among cactus species assemblages along a 798 km long latitudinal megatransect across the Chihuahuan Desert Region, from north-central Mexico to southern Texas. A total of 71 cactus species were found along the megatransect, 66.2% of which appeared at low frequencies, mostly as a consequence of their highly discontinuous distribution pattern. At the scale the study was conducted, there was always species turnover among cactus assemblages. The rate of turnover among contiguous sites primarily fluctuated from low to medium, but when all site combinations were considered (contiguous and non-contiguous), medium beta diversity values were predominant (beta = 0.331-0.66); however, 25.4% of the site pair combinations registered high values (beta = 0.661-1.0). Our results showed that turnover among cactus species assemblages in the CDR does not consist for the most part of a process of species succession in the geographic space. Instead, we concluded that the continuous spatial changes in cactus species composition are primarily explained by the commonly intermittent distribution patterns of the species, by the presence in the megatransect of species at the margin of their distribution range, and, to a lesser extent, by the existence of narrowly endemic species.

Avian life-history determinants of local extinction risk in a hyper-fragmented neotropical forest landscape	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						Brazil; birds; life history; conservation; rainforest; habitat fragmentation; extinction risk	INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS; AVIFAUNAL COLLAPSE; BODY-SIZE; BRAZIL; VULNERABILITY; TERRITORY; AMAZONIA; THREAT; DEBT	The fact that species vary in their vulnerability to extinction is well documented, but the reasons for these differences remain poorly understood. Why should some species/families/guilds decline rapidly with increasing anthropogenic disturbance, while others either tolerate or proliferate in disturbed habitats? We investigated the bird species composition in 31 primary forest patches of varying size in a region of the Amazonian 'Arc of Deforestation' and assessed which species life-history traits predisposed individual species to extinction. Medium-sized non-flocking canopy frugivores/ominvores of low primary forest dependence were least likely to go extinct in small patches, while small-bodied flock-following primary-forest-dependent terrestrial insectivores were most fragmentation sensitive. We found highly idiosyncratic relationships between the minimum size of forest patches occupied by different species and their territory size requirements estimated based on other Amazonian studies. This suggests that avian assemblages in forest fragments primarily comprise species that either have good dispersal abilities or are highly tolerant to the non-forest matrix, rather than those whose minimum spatial requirements can be met by the size of available forest fragments.

J	Ma, MH				Ma, Maohua			Multi-scale responses of plant species diversity in semi-natural buffer strips to agricultural landscapes	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE			English	Article						agriculture; evenness; Finland; land use; species richness	FIELD BOUNDARIES; CHANGING SCALE; RICHNESS; BIODIVERSITY; EVENNESS; HABITAT; POPULATION; FARMLAND; COMMUNITIES; MANAGEMENT	Question: How does agricultural land usage affect plant species diversity in semi-natural buffer strips at multiple scales? Location: Leps m River watershed, Nurmijarvi, Southern Finland. Methods: Species diversity indicators included both richness and evenness. Plant communities in buffer strips were surveyed in 29 sampling sites. Using ArcGIS Desktop 9.0 (ArcInfo) and Fragstats 3.3 for GIS analysis, the landscape composition around each sampling site was characterized by seven parameters in square sectors at five scales: 4, 36, 100, 196, and 324 ha. For each scale, Principle Component Analysis was used to examine the importance of each structural metric to diversity indicators using multiple regression and other simple analyses. Results: For all but the smallest scales (4 ha), two structural metrics including the diversity of land cover types and percentage of arable land were positively and negatively correlated with species richness, respectively. Both metrics had the highest correlation coefficients for species richness at the second largest scale (196 ha). The density of arable field edges between the fields was the only metric that correlated with species evenness for all scales, which had highest predictive power at the second smallest scale (36 ha). Conclusions: Species richness and evenness of buffer strips had scale-dependent relationships to land use in agricultural ecosystems. The results of this study indicated that species richness depends on the pattern of arable land use at large scales, which may relate to the regional species pool. Meanwhile, species evenness depended on the level of field edge density at small scales, which relates to how the nearby farmland was divided by the edges (e. g. many small-scale fields with high edge density or a few big-scale fields with low edge density). This implies that it is important to manage the biodiversity of buffer strips within a landscape context at multiple scales.

J	Mamede, MD; de Araujo, FS				Mamede, M. de A.; de Araujo, F. S.			Effects of slash and burn practices on a soil seed bank of caatinga vegetation in Northeastern Brazil	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						agricultural practices; biodiversity; fire; seedling emergence; semiarid tropical zone (SAT); plant life-form	DIVERSITY; DYNAMICS; REGION; FOREST	The semiarid tropical zone covers 20% of Brazil and is dominated by caatinga, a thorny deciduous savanna well adapted to seasonal water shortage and periodic drought years. This study was focused on effects of slash and burn agriculture on the soil seed bank in a Caatinga area, in Sobral, CE, Brazil. Caatinga is rich in species, called therophytes, which remain as seeds in the soil during unfavorable seasons and rely on regeneration from the soil seed bank for persistence in the environment. Although slash and burn agriculture has been intensified in the region for the past three centuries, its effects on the soil seed bank are not well known. A seedling emergence greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate differences in seed bank density and diversity among soil samples collected before and after an experimental burning. Soil samples were previously submitted to sequential sieving to assess fire effects on different-sized seeds. Fire significantly reduced overall seed bank density, with smaller sieving fractions being most strongly affected. Shanon's diversity index was also lowered by fire. Combined, these results show that agricultural practices represent a serious threat to plant biodiversity conservation in the Caatinga biome. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The uniform pattern of the coffee plants and shade trees allows for the study of pattern generation through intrinsic biological forces rather than extrinsic habitat patchiness. Detailed studies, focusing on a key mutualism between an ant (Azteca instabilis) and a scale insect (Coccus viridis), conducted in a 45-ha plot in a coffee agroforestry system have provided insights into (1) the quantitative evaluation of spatial pattern of the scale insect Coccus viridis on coffee bushes, (2) the mechanisms for the generation of patterns through the combination of local satellite ant nest formation and regional control from natural enemies, and (3) the consequences of the spatial pattern for the stability of predator-prey (host parasitoid) systems, for a key coccinelid beetle preying on the scale insects and a phorid fly parasitoid parasitizing the ant.

Pattern and divergence of tree communities in Taipei's main urban green spaces	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article						hybrid park; precision urban forestry; urban ecology; urban flora; urban green space; urban nature conservation	BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION; NATURE CONSERVATION; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; FLORA; FOREST; URBANIZATION; VEGETATION; RICHNESS; CHINA	Urban vegetation increasingly contributes to nature conservation and ecosystem services, but lacking understanding of site variations has restricted such uses. This study analyzed the spatial pattern and differentiation of tree communities in three major green landscape types (urban parks, riverside parks and street verges) in Taipei city. In each landscape type, 10 representative tree communities were studied. Statistical tests for ecological communities were employed: Jaccard and Q species similarity indices, two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), and new species fidelity, landscape fidelity and composite Q indices. Significant recent increase in Taipei's green spaces was traced. The study area contained 164 tree species, but few were shared by the three landscape types and none by 30 communities. Native evergreen broadleaf species with large final dimensions were dominant. Urban parks registered the highest species richness, landscape fidelity, rare species and urban endemics. Such exclusive species constitution deviated notably from riverside parks and street verges, with relatively simple and converging intra-site species ingredients. Pronounced species differentiation between urban parks reflected diversified site topography, natural woodland inheritance, woodland creation, and past landscape fashion. TWINSPAN classified the communities into nine groups each with signature characteristics. Inherent site variations offered main determinants of tree heterogeneity, superimposed by human modification to satisfy pre-determined site functions. A hybrid urban park with high species diversity and nature contents is advocated by amalgamating conventional but polarized designs of country and urban parks. The findings could inform management of urban forest, urban nature conservation, and ecological services of urban green spaces. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Jim, C.

Diatoms community structure in superficial sediments of eight Andean lakes of central Chile	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL			Spanish	Article						species composition; Bacillariophyceae; superficial sediment; Andean lake; Chile	PEDRO VIII REGION; ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES; ASSEMBLAGES; INDICATORS; BACILLARIOPHYCEAE; PHYTOPLANKTON; RECORDS	In this research the taxonomic structure of diatoms in sediments of high mountain lakes was studied. These lakes are located in Chile between 32 degrees 49' and 38 degrees 48' S in the Andean Cordillera. A total of 99 diatom taxa distributed in 48 genera were identified and all this taxa are cosmopolitan excepting a Eunotia andinofrequens, Gomphonema punae, Pinnularia araucanensis and Pinnularia acidicola, which are know only for the Southern Hemisphere. The assemblages of diatoms were different in the studied lakes. So the high mountain lakes Ocho, Huifa, Ensueno and Negra, dominated benthic diatoms which are typical of oligotrophic and acid waters as Achnanthidium exiguum, Achnanthidium minutissimum, Encyonema minutum, Pinnularia acidicola and Planothidium lanceolatum. In the assemblages from lakes Galletue, Icalma and Laja planktonic diatoms were more abundant, which are common in alkaline and mesotrophic waters, e.g., Asterionella formosa, Aulacoseira distans, Aulacoseira granulata, Cyclotella stelligera and Rhopalodia gibba.

Depth-specific patterns of benthic secondary production in an oligotrophic lake	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						secondary production; benthic macroinvertebrate; lake; littoral; food web	FOOD WEBS; ARCTIC LAKES; STREAM; PATHWAYS; MACROINVERTEBRATES; THINGVALLAVATN; INVERTEBRATES; POPULATIONS; ZOOBENTHOS; ABUNDANCE	Benthic secondary production plays an important role in the population, community, and ecosystem dynamics of lakes. However, whole-lake estimates of benthic secondary production are rare, and very little is known about intralake patterns in production. We measured benthic secondary production for the dominant macroinvertebrate taxa in Crampton Lake, a 26-ha north-temperate lake at the border of Wisconsin and Michigan, USA. Production was estimated by the size-frequency method for each taxon at each depth where it occurred. Confidence intervals for production estimates were determined by bootstrapping. A small number of taxa were responsible for most benthic secondary production, and most taxa were not highly productive. Thus, we observed a log-normal rank-production relationship. This relationship might be common in other lakes. However, production was not strongly related to abundance, a result that suggests that even rare taxa might contribute substantially to secondary production. Whole-lake benthic secondary production averaged 4.4 g dry mass m(-2) y(-1). Across depths, confidence intervals for area-specific rates of production generally overlapped, although point estimates were somewhat higher in the littoral zone (4.8-6.5) than in the profundal zone (3.2-4.5). Despite this similarity in rates, >65% of whole-lake benthic secondary production occurred in the littoral zone because of lake morphometry. A synthesis of limited published data revealed multiple patterns in the relationship between depth and benthic secondary production in other lakes. In most lakes, area-specific rates of production either declined or remained constant as depth increased. This observation, combined with the fact that most lakes are small and predominantly littoral, suggests that littoral dominance of whole-lake benthic secondary production might be widespread, and might help explain recent findings that lake fishes rely heavily on littoral production.

Results show that: (i) the distribution of macrobenthic assemblages was roughly determined by the vegetation as major structuring factor and by sediment, pH and dissolved oxygen; (ii) the overall faunal composition, species distribution and community structure in the Smir lagoon were comparable to those reported for other Moroccan brackish ecosystems (iii) the trophic structure was exclusively dominated by detritivores and (iv), the lagoon was a slightly disturbed ecosystem with unbalanced communities.

Spatial scale, abundance and the species-energy relationship in British birds	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						energy availability; sampling effects; spatial turnover; species richness; temperature; temporal turnover	RICHNESS ESTIMATORS; AREA RELATIONSHIPS; REGIONAL SCALES; PRODUCTIVITY; PATTERNS; DIVERSITY; TURNOVER; ECOLOGY; BRITAIN; PERFORMANCE	1. The spatial scale of analysis may influence the nature, strength and underlying drivers of macroecological patterns, one of the most frequently discussed of which is the relationship between species richness and environmental energy availability. 2. It has been suggested that species-energy relationships are hump-shaped at fine spatial grains and consistently positive at larger regional grains. The exact nature of this scale dependency is, however, the subject of much debate as relatively few studies have investigated species-energy relationships for the same assemblage across a range of spatial grains. Here, we contrast species-energy relationships for the British breeding avifauna at spatial grains of 1 km x 1 km, 2 km x 2 km and 10 km x 10 km plots, while maintaining a constant spatial extent. 3. Analyses were principally conducted using data on observed species richness. While survey work may fail to detect some species, observed species richness and that estimated using nonparametric techniques were strongly positively correlated with each other, and thus exhibit very similar spatial patterns. Moreover, the forms of species-energy relationships using observed and estimated species richness were statistically indistinguishable from each other. 4. Positive decelerating species-energy relationships arise at all three spatial grains. There is little evidence that the explanatory power of these relationships varies with spatial scale. However, ratios of regional (large-scale) to local (small-scale) species richness decrease with increasing energy availability, indicating that local richness responds to energy with a steeper gradient than does regional richness. Local assemblages thus sample a greater proportion of regional richness at higher energy levels, suggesting that spatial turnover of species richness is lower in high-energy regions. Similarly, a crude measure of temporal turnover, the ratio of cumulative species richness over a 4-year period to species richness in a single year, is lower in high-energy regions. These negative relationships between turnover and energy appear to be causal as both total and mean occupancy per species increases with energy. 5. While total density in 1 km x 1 km plots correlates positively with energy availability, such relationships are very weak for mean density per species. This suggests that the observed association between total abundance and species richness may not be mediated by population extinction rates, as predicted by the more individuals hypothesis. 6. The sampling mechanism suggests that species-energy relationships arise as high-energy areas support a greater number of individuals, and that random allocation of these individuals to local areas from a regional assemblage will generate species-energy relationships. While randomized local species-energy relationships are linear and positive, predicted richness is consistently greater than that observed. The mismatch between the observed and randomized species-energy relationships probably arises as a consequence of the aggregated nature of species distributions. The sampling mechanism, together with species spatial aggregation driven by limited habitat availability, may thus explain the species-energy relationship observed at this spatial scale.

Disregarding topographical heterogeneity biases species turnover assessments based on bioclimatic models	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						butterflies; climate change; colonization; Europe; extinction; scenarios; topography; turnover	CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENVELOPE MODELS; EXTINCTION RISK; DISTRIBUTIONS; BUTTERFLIES; RICHNESS; IMPACTS; BIODIVERSITY; PATTERNS; UNCERTAINTIES	We investigated whether the inclusion of topographical heterogeneity in bioclimatic envelope models would significantly alter predictions of climate change - induced broad-scale butterfly species range size changes in Europe. Using generalized additive models, and data on current climate and species distributions and two different climate scenarios (HadCM3A2 and HadCM3B2) for the period 2051-2080, we developed predictions of the currently suitable area and potential range size changes of 100 European butterfly species. The inclusion of elevation range increased the predictive accuracy of climate-only models for 86 of the 100 species. The differences in projected future distributions were most notable in mountainous areas, where the climate-topography models projected only ca. half of the species losses than the climate-only models. By contrast, climate-topography models estimated double the losses of species than climate-only models in the flatlands regions. Our findings suggest that disregarding topographical heterogeneity may cause a significant source of error in broad-scale bioclimatic modelling. Mountainous regions are likely to be even more important for future conservation of species than had until now been predicted, based on bioclimatic envelope models that did not take an explicit account of elevational range of grid squares.

Landscape mosaic of Araucaria forest and forest monocultures influencing understorey spider assemblages in southern Brazil	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Atlantic forest; forest management; habitat connectivity; habitat structure; tree monocultures	COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION; ARTHROPOD COMMUNITIES; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; PREY AVAILABILITY; HABITAT STRUCTURE; LODGEPOLE PINE; FOOD-WEB; MANAGEMENT; ABUNDANCE; ARANEAE	This study investigates how abundance, diversity and composition of understorey spiders were influenced by four different forest habitats in a southern Brazilian Araucaria forest. The study area encompasses a landscape mosaic comprised of Araucaria forest, Araucaria plantation, Pinus plantation, and Eucalyptus plantation. Understorey spiders were collected by beating the vegetation inside three patches of each forest habitat. To assess possible predictors of spider assemblage structure, several patch features were analysed: potential prey abundances, estimation of vegetation cover, diversity index of vegetation types, patch ages, patch areas, and geographical distance between patches. To assess the influence of high-level taxa approaches on spider assemblage patterns, analyses were carried out individually for family, genera and species levels. Additionally, Mantel tests were carried out in underlying similarity matrices between each taxon. Significant differences in spider abundances among forest habitats were found. Pinus plantations showed the highest abundance of spiders and Eucalyptus plantations showed the lowest abundance. Spider abundance was significantly influenced by patch ages, geographical distance and vegetation cover. Expected numbers of families, genera and species did not vary among forest habitats. Spider composition of two Eucalyptus patches differed from the other forest patches, probably due to their low vegetation cover and isolation. Genera composition was the best correlate of species composition, showing that a higher-level surrogate can be an alternative to the species approach. The understorey spider diversity in this managed area could be maintained when suitable habitat structures are provided, thus ensuring the connectivity between different habitat types. Further studies should focus on individual species responses to the conversion of native forest to monocultures.

J	Koontz, TM; Bodine, J				Koontz, Tomas M.; Bodine, Jennifer			Implementing ecosystem management in public agencies: Lessons from the US Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						Bureau of Land Management; ecosystem management; federal agencies; natural resource agencies; stakeholder collaboration; US Forest Service	ENVIRONMENTAL-POLICY; ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT; RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT; UNITED-STATES; COMMAND	Ecosystem management was formally adopted over a decade ago by many U.S. natural resource agencies, including the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. This approach calls for management based on stakeholder collaboration; interagency cooperation; integration of scientific, social, and economic information; preservation of ecological processes; and adaptive management. Results of previous studies indicate differences in the extent to which particular components of ecosystem management would be implemented within the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management and suggest a number of barriers thought to impede implementation. Drawing on survey and interview data from agency personnel and stakeholders, we compared levels of ecosystem-management implementation in the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management and identified the most important barriers to implementation. Agency personnel perceived similarly high levels of implementation on many ecosystem-management components, whereas stakeholders perceived lower levels. Agencies were most challenged by implementation of preservation of ecological processes, adaptive management, and integration of social and economic information, whereas the most significant barriers to implementation were political, cultural, and legal.

J	Askegaard, M; Eriksen, J				Askegaard, Margrethe; Eriksen, Jorgen			Residual effect and leaching of N and K in cropping systems with clover and ryegrass catch crops on a coarse sand	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						organic agriculture; white clover; red clover; perennial ryegrass; animal manure; low soil fertility	CONTRASTING NITROGEN AVAILABILITY; TRIFOLIUM-REPENS; GREEN MANURES; SPRING BARLEY; WHITE CLOVER; N-2 FIXATION; SOIL; POTASSIUM; FERTILIZER; ROTATIONS	In low input farming systems without inorganic N-fertilizer input, cereal cropping is a challenge because of the need for an adequate N supply. The objective of this investigation was to explore the feasibility of using clover (red/white) catch crops instead of ryegrass in crop production on coarse sand. Two field experiments tested the effects of clover and ryegrass catch crops on N and K leaching and on grain yield of a succeeding spring barley. Treatments included animal manure regimes, main crops (spring barley = low soil N status or lupin = high soil N status) and levels of K fertilizer (no K or 80 kg K ha(-1)). The residual effect of the clover catch crop on grain yield of the succeeding spring barley was significantly higher than that of the ryegrass, especially under the low N conditions. When animal manure (70 kg total-N ha(-1)) was added to the spring barley succeeding a ryegrass catch crop, the difference in residual effect between clover and ryegrass catch crops disappeared. Thus, clover appeared to have the potential to substitute animal manure. Leaching of NO3-N and K was estimated by means of porous ceramic suction cups installed at 1 m depth. Both the clover and ryegrass catch crops reduced the annual flow-weighted mean NO3-N concentrations from 13-16 to 5-8 mg L-1, which is below the WHO maximum for drinking water. The annual NO3-N leaching from a spring barley treatment without catch crops was approximately 100 kg ha(-1). Clover and ryegrass catch crops reduced the losses significantly by approximately 40-80% depending on year and treatment, with ryegrass being more effective than clover. Catch crops reduced K leaching significantly but the relative effect was lower than for N. The clover catch crops appeared suitable for low-N cropping systems on coarse sand with respect to both production and environment. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Diets of native and introduced mammalian herbivores in shrub-encroached grassy woodland, south-eastern Australia	WILDLIFE RESEARCH			English	Article							NATIONAL-PARK; NEW-ZEALAND; LEPTOSPERMUM-LAEVIGATUM; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; THEMEDA-TRIANDRA; SEASONAL-CHANGES; GREY-KANGAROO; FIRE; SAVANNA; COMPETITION	Effective management of sympatric mammalian herbivore populations requires an understanding of interspecific interactions. At Wilsons Promontory National Park, Victoria, sympatric native and introduced mammalian herbivores are thought to be contributing to modi. cation of shrub-encroached Coastal Grassy Woodland. We estimated the diets of the five terrestrial mammalian herbivore species present using microhistological techniques. The diets of introduced hog deer (Axis porcinus) and native swamp wallabies (Wallabia bicolor) consisted mainly of dicots. The diet of introduced European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) contained similar proportions of monocots and dicots. The diets of native eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) and native common wombats (Vombatus ursinus) consisted mainly of monocots but kangaroos also consumed moderate amounts of dicots. Deer and wallabies consumed more native plants than did the other species and rabbits consumed more exotic plants than did all other species except kangaroos. Diet breadth was narrowest for kangaroos and broadest for swamp wallabies and hog deer. Overlap in food use by the five herbivores was high, particularly between deer and wallabies, and between kangaroos and both rabbits and wombats. Our results suggest that the potential impacts of native and introduced species on the vegetation of Coastal Grassy Woodland are similar, and that the entire herbivore assemblage will need to be managed to increase. ne fuel loads if. re is used as a restoration tool.

In addition to blocking fish migration, small surface-release dams on coldwater streams generally increase water temperature below the dam. The goal of this study was to evaluate how small, surface-release dams affect Fish communities, separating the total effect into components related to fragmentation and habitat alteration. The approach taken in this study was to synthesize results of two large studies conducted in the Laurentian Great Lakes basin. The first study focused on low-head barriers (<0.5 m in height) built to prevent the upstream migration of sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus. In this study, 24 streams with sea lamprey barriers and 23 nearby reference streams without barriers were sampled. The second study evaluated 10 small hydroelectric dams. Dams that do not substantially warm downstream water temperature cause a moderate shift in fish community composition, whereas dams that warm downstream water temperature by more than 2 degrees C cause substantial shifts in fish community composition. The abundance of stream resident coldwater species such as brook Salvelinus fontinalis and brown trout Salmo trutta does not appear to be affected by the presence of a barrier. Dams that increase water temperature result in substantial reductions in abundance, however. These results suggest that the effect of habitat alteration caused by dams on coldwater streams should receive as much, if not greater attention, as the effect of habitat and population fragmentation.

Surrogate measures for assessing cryptic faunal biodiversity on macroalgal-dominated subtidal reefs	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						marine biodiversity mapping; rapid-assessment; higher taxon richness; crustaceans; epifauna	HERBIVOROUS MARINE AMPHIPOD; TAXONOMIC RESOLUTION; MOBILE EPIFAUNA; MACROBENTHIC COMMUNITY; SPECIES RICHNESS; INDICATOR GROUPS; SOUTH-AUSTRALIA; PLANT DIVERSITY; FOOD CHOICE; ASSEMBLAGES	A major impediment to the identification of priority areas for marine biodiversity conservation is a fundamental lack of information about the distribution of many marine species. Comprehensive species inventories for many areas currently do not exist, and performing detailed taxonomic surveys is often prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Accordingly, there is a need to develop simple and reliable rapid-assessment techniques for mapping marine biodiversity. One potential approach is to use 'surrogates' that function as proxies for the distribution of other, less easily sampled, 'cryptic' biota. Two potential surrogates for predicting arthropod faunal biodiversity on rock subtidal reefs were investigated in this study: (1) macroalgae, and (2) faunal subsets derived by aggregating the arthropod fauna at higher taxonomic levels. Faunal and macroalgal assemblage composition was only weakly correlated across sites reflecting broad faunal responses to changes in algal structural complexity and/or common environmental gradients. This suggests that algal species composition may not be very informative in mapping patterns of faunal species distribution on reefs. Instead, the best surrogates were related (i.e. nested), subsets of the faunal assemblages such as family-level taxon richness which was found to be a good predictor of arthropod species richness at independent test sites.

The vigor-organization-resillence concept of ecological health: Lessons from temperate warmwater stream fish communities	RECONCILING FISHERIES WITH CONSERVATION, VOLS I AND II	AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY SYMPOSIUM		English	Proceedings Paper	4th World Fisheries Congress	MAY 02-06, 2004	Vancouver, CANADA					An ecologically healthysystem is able to maintain vigor, or function, and organization, or structure, in the presence of disturbance (resilience). Measures of ecological vigor, such as abundance, productivity, and biomass, are relatively simple to obtain in the field, as are measures of organization, such as species richness and diversity. However, determination of system resilience in the field is less than straightforward because of its dependence on the nature of the disturbance and on the choice of endpoints for system recovery. We investigated the vigor, organization, and resilience of temperate warmwater stream fish communities subject to controlled disturbance to determine what relationships, if any, existed among these variables and stream habitat quality. We measured community resilience in a number of ways, including level of and time to recovery of fish density, richness, diversity, and community structure. We found no significant relationship between habitat quality and vigor or organization of the study communities or their recovery, although some individual physical parameters were significant. Interestingly, there was no relationship between the predisturbance vigor or organization of the fish community and its resilience to disturbance. While we found that measuring postdisturbance changes in structure and abundance over time was useful in determining recovery, these resilience values are applicable only to one type of disturbance at one spatial and temporal scale. Although vigor and organization may serve as partial indicators of community health, a measurement of resilience to various types of disturbance would be invaluable for stream fishery management and warrants further research.

Over 2700 scats with identifiable prey were collected from the northern, eastern, southern and western sides of Kodiak Island from 1999 to 2005. Of 76 prey types identified using hard remains, the most important species in terms of frequency of occurrence and numerical abundance were Pacific sand lance Ammodytes hexapterus, walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma, arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias, Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus, salmon Oncorhynchus spp., and Pacific herring Clupea pallasi. Significant differences in diet composition were found among regions, seasons, and years, suggesting that the diet of sea lions is strongly influenced by local and temporal distributions and abundances of prey. Herring dominated scat collections from the west coast and accounted for most (14 to 30%) of the differences in regional diet in spring and winter. Annual variation in diet was relatively low in winter, whereas spring and fall diets varied from year to year, with regional-specific shifts in dominant prey. Results from our study generally agree with diet studies conducted in the 1990s, but differ markedly in the relative importance of the major prey species.

Importance of trophic information, simplification and aggregation error in ecosystem models	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						diet; qualitative modelling; model structure; regular equivalence	FOOD-WEB; ECOLOGICAL MODELS; NEW-ZEALAND; FISHES; DIET; COMPLEXITY; PREDATORS; AUSTRALIA; OVERLAP; GUILDS	Ecosystem models are becoming increasingly important as pressure from fisheries intensifies and ecosystem-based fisheries management becomes more widely used. Trophic webs often form the basis of ecosystem models and ecosystem-specific dietary information is crucial for optimal model performance. This is particularly the case if model predictions are used in management decisions. The Tasmanian live fish fishery for banded morwong was used as a case study to investigate the importance of trophic information, model simplification and aggregation error on ecosystem model results. Dietary analysis of 6 commonly captured reef fish was undertaken. Significant trophic overlap was found between blue throat wrasse Notolabrus tetricus and purple wrasse N. fucicola, and banded morwong Cheilodactylus spectabilis and bastard trumpeter Latridopsis forsteri. Marblefish Aplodactylus arctidens and long-snouted boarfish Pentaceropsis recurvirostris had significantly different diets from other species studied. Using this information, a detailed qualitative model was produced and then simplified through the aggregation of variables. Variables were aggregated using 3 methods: Euclidean distance, Bray-Curtis similarity, and regular equivalence for inclusion in 3 simplified models. Variable aggregation is undertaken in many studies and may create aggregation error. Each aggregation method produced a different proportion of incorrect model predictions as a result of aggregation error. The model simplified using regular equivalence produced the least aggregation error and a web structure aligned with the dietary analysis. More widespread use of these methods in fisheries management should be considered.	[Metcalf, S. J.; Hobday, A. J.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Zool, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Metcalf, S. J.; Hobday, A.

We tested this hypothesis for aquatic insect communities in tank-forming bromeliads in forested and non-forested habitats in Costa Rica. Bromeliad tanks hold much of the standing water in this region and therefore provide an important resource for insects with aquatic larval stages. We quantified the relative importance of land-use type and the bromeliad-specific "local" environment on the insect community, and also the effect of land-use type on this local environment. Insect species responded to both land-use type and the local environment, with these variables explaining a total of 36% of species densities. The local environment independently explained 19% of insect densities, while land-use type explained 17%, mainly through its modification of the local environment. Local environmental conditions were strongly correlated to land-use type (r(2) = 0.64), with non-forest habitat having a higher average temperature, a greater variation in temperature, and a lower density of bromeliads. Our results indicate that the land-use type in which bromeliads occur influences the relative densities of insects by altering the local environment of bromeliads. Therefore, maintaining bromeliads under land-use conversion will not necessarily maintain the bromeliad insect community of the original forested habitat.

Boreal forest conservation has been based on several assumptions about forest age that only consider species richness without accounting for species composition. It has also been guided by studies of incomplete chronologies that do not include naturally burned or old-growth stages. Twenty-one forest stands of different ages following fire - from recently burned to old-growth stages (0-340 years of age) - were sampled, revealing a strong relationship between age of forest and diversity of Carabidae. Over time, species richness followed a parabolic U-shaped pattern both with observed (Obs) and predicted richness (ACE). Chronological clustering identified four groups of species in the succession: the 'burned' group characterized 0-2-year-old forests, 'regenerating' (21-58 year), 'mature' (70-170 year) and 'old-growth' (177-340 year). The time spans corresponding to each of these assemblages lengthen with age of forest at an exponential rate. Ward's and K-means (clustering without constraint) provided support for the four assemblages but showed variation between individual successions, particularly for the 'regenerating' assemblage, identified as the most heterogeneous. The IndVal method identified characteristic species in every stage of the succession, particularly Sericoda spp. in the burned stage and Dromius piceus and Platynus mannerheinmii associated with old-growth stands. The results obtained here show that diversity of Carabidae varies in primeval conditions according to age of forest and such variation should be taken into account when conservation issues are involved.

Interspecific and seasonal dietary differences of Himalayan thar, chamois and brushtail possums in the central Southern Alps, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						competition; Hemitragus jemlahicus; Himalayan tahr; Horn's index; niche overlap; Rupicapra rupicapra; Trichosurus vulpecula; ungulates	TAHR HEMITRAGUS-JEMLAHICUS; RUPICAPRA-RUPICAPRA; COMPETITION; MANAGEMENT; MAMMALS	Himalayan thar or tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus), Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) and brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) are native to the Himalaya, Europe and Australia, respectively, but are now sympatric in parts of the central Southern Alps, New Zealand. All three species are managed as pests by the Department of Conservation. We analysed the diets of 246 thar, 78 chamois and 113 possums collected in the central Southern Alps during 1988-1996. The diets of thar and chamois strongly overlapped, but thar ate more grasses and less herbs and woody plants than chamois. The diet of possums differed from the diets of thar and chamois, containing a different suite of herbs and almost no grasses. The diets of that, chamois and possums varied seasonally. Contrary to expectation, the diets of adult male and female thar were similar during the period when they are spatially segregated (October-May). Chamois sampled outside the thar range ate more species than those sampled inside the thar range, suggesting the presence of thar modifies the diet of chamois. If managers wish to protect the dominant Chionochloa snow tussocks then thar should be controlled; chamois should be controlled to protect herbs such as Ranunculus spp.; and possums should be controlled if Podocarpus nivalis or Muehlenbeckia axillaris need to be protected. However, managers need to be aware of the potential for chamois to increase in abundance, at least in some sites, if thar are controlled to low abundance, and that this could lead to different impacts on plant populations.

Forest management, restoration, and designer ecosystems: Integrating strategies for a crowded planet	ECOSCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Restoring and Designing Ecosystems for a Crowded Planet - Provision of Ecosystem Services or Mere Window Dressing	AUG, 2005	Montreal, CANADA	ESA		designer ecosystems; restoration; sustainable forestry portfolios	URBAN ECOSYSTEMS; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY; PACIFIC-NORTHWEST; UNITED-STATES; LAND-COVER; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; PLANTATIONS	As the global human population increases, the demand to conserve, restore, create, and sustainably manage ecosystems will increase as well. Forested ecosystems are of particular interest because of the biodiversity they support and their diverse values to people. Developments in conservation, restoration forestry, and in the study of designer ecosystems provide a diverse set of tools with which to pursue sustainable forestry goals. Nonetheless, we suggest that sustainable forestry can only be achieved by fully considering ecological, economic, and social needs in landscapes. This will require a clear realization of the trade-offs in site-specific management approaches and a multifaceted, landscape-scale perspective for evaluation of sustainability criteria. We propose collaborative creation of Sustainable Forestry Portfolios as a means to encourage the breadth of thinking required to guide sustainable forest management. We discuss 3 examples of Sustainable Forestry Portfolios with relevance to different settings in the future: 1) the Triad Approach, 2) Forest Landscape Restoration, and 3) Urban Forestry. In all settings, sustainable forestry is not solely a technical problem, but a challenge that must be met through a multidimensional perspective, interdisciplinary collaboration, and with active engagement of the people that live and work in the landscape.

P. Hubbell's unified neutral theory of biodiversity has stimulated much new thinking about biodiversity. However, empirical support for the neutral theory is limited., and several observations are inconsistent with the predictions of the theory, including positive correlations between traits associated with competitive ability and species abundance and correlations between species diversity and ecosystem functioning. The neutral theory can be extended to explain these observations by allowing species to differ slightly in their competitive ability (fitness). Here, we show that even slight differences in fecundity can greatly reduce the time to extinction of competitors even when the community size is large and dispersal is spatially limited. In this case, species richness is dramatically reduced, and a markedly different species abundance distribution is predicted than under pure neutrality. In the nearly neutral model, species co-occur in the same community not because of, but in spite of, ecological differences. The more competitive species with higher fecundity tend to have higher abundance both in the metacommunity and in local communities. The nearly neutral perspective provides a theoretical framework that unites the sampling model of the neutral theory with theory of biodiversity affecting ecosystem function.

We developed a new multiple-site similarity measure, which is independent of richness and performs better than the Diserud-Odegaard index under conditions of equal richness between sites, because it discriminates between situations in which shared species are distributed evenly among sites or concentrated in few pairs of sites. We conducted several simulations to assess the relative performance of both the indices. The use of the new measure is recommended, enabling the simultaneous analysis of turnover and richness gradients based on two independent measures.

J	Brown, WP				Brown, William P.			Body mass, habitat generality, and avian community composition in forest remnants	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						biogeography; community assembly; conservation biology; deforestation; Delaware forest fragmentation; interspecific competition; USA	INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; LANDSCAPE CONTEXT; BREEDING BIRDS; DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS; NESTING SUCCESS; WOOD THRUSHES; PATCH SCALE; COUNT DATA; BLUE-JAYS; FRAGMENTATION	Aim Many theories of biodiversity and biogeography assume that species respond equally to variability in habitat area and isolation. This assumption does not allow for differential responses due to interspecific competition or other mechanisms, and therefore does not allow community composition to be predicted. As body size is relevant to area requirements and interspecific dominance, a natural experiment was conducted to quantify the differential responses of avian species abundance to variability in remnant area, isolation and forest cover based on average species body mass. Location Deciduous forest remnants of varying area and isolation throughout the State of Delaware, USA. Methods Forest remnants within stratified area and isolation classes were randomly selected for breeding bird surveys; total forest cover (ha) within 2 km of each survey point was subsequently determined as a covariate. Surveys were conducted within 100-150 m from the edge of each remnant and detected bird species were divided into five classes based on a log(2)-transformation of body mass (very small, small, medium, large and very large). Assuming a negative binomial distribution, the abundance of detected individuals in each mass class was analysed using generalized linear models with remnant area, isolation, local forest cover and two-way interactions specified as independent variables. The same analyses were conducted for individual species where sample size allowed. Results Very small, small and very large bodied species decreased in abundance with decreasing local forest cover and remnant area and with increasing remnant isolation, while large species increased in abundance. Medium-sized species decreased in abundance with increasing forest cover, did not respond to remnant isolation and showed a concave, curvilinear response to increasing remnant area. Large and medium-sized species were the most abundant birds in small, isolated remnants despite occurring in the largest remnants with the more abundant very small and small species, suggesting that communities are not randomly organized. Main conclusions Regardless of presumed habitat associations, large and medium-sized species are of the appropriate size to be dominant competitors when forest resources are limiting, and thus may be considered 'generalists'. The smallest species may be excluded entirely from small, isolated remnants even though such remnants meet their ecological needs; the needs of very large species are not met in small remnants. The applicability of biodiversity theories to community composition, species abundance and, by extension, to conservation, can be improved by incorporating differential responses based on body mass into their assumptions.

Prey selection of subyearling Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout coexisting in a natural stream	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY			English	Article							COMPETITIVE EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE; FORAGING MODE SHIFT; BROOK TROUT; BROWN TROUT; SALVELINUS-FONTINALIS; ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS; COHO SALMON; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; DOMINANCE HIERARCHY; MOUNTAIN STREAM	Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are similar ecologically but share no coevolutionary history favoring the evolution of niche-partitioning mechanisms. Therefore, interspecific competition may occur as each species becomes naturalized throughout the other's native range. As a first step towards investigating competitive interactions, we tested hypotheses regarding prey selection in allopatric and sympatric populations of Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout in a natural stream. Diet samples from 184 fish and contemporary drift samples were collected during a 24-hour period in mid-summer. Diet overlap was low between salmon and trout in allopatry, but high in sympatry. Salmon consumed more prey and a greater proportion of baetid mayflies than did trout, which fed more frequently on chironomid larvae and aerial-terrestrial invertebrates. Both species consumed larger prey when allopatric than when sympatric. Salmon in allopatry fed as generalists and trout in allopatry fed as specialists, but diets converged when in sympatry. Feeding habits of both salmonines seemed to be affected by the other's presence, although more notably for trout. Results were more consistent with predictions based on optimal foraging theory than on niche-partitioning theory.

Slopes of Avian Species-Area Relationships, Human Population Density, and Environmental Factors	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						habitat diversity; human population density; macroecology; spatial statistics; species-area relationships		There is increasing interest in how humans influence spatial patterns in biodiversity. One of the most frequently noted and marked of these patterns is the increase in species richness with area, the species-area relationship (SAR). SARs are used for a number of conservation purposes, including predicting extinction rates, setting conservation targets, and identifying biodiversity hotspots. Such applications can be improved by a detailed understanding of the factors promoting spatial variation in the slope of SARs, which is currently the subject of a vigorous debate. Moreover, very few studies have considered the anthropogenic influences on the slopes of SARs; this is particularly surprising given that in much of the world areas with high human population density are typically those with a high number of species, which generates conservation conflicts. Here we determine correlates of spatial variation in the slopes of species-area relationships, using the British avifauna as a case study. Whilst we focus on human population density, a widely used index of human activities, we also take into account (1) the rate of increase in habitat heterogeneity with increasing area, which is frequently proposed to drive SARs, (2) environmental energy availability, which may influence SARs by affecting species occupancy patterns, and (3) species richness. We consider environmental variables measured at both local (10 km x 10 km) and regional (290 km x 290 km) spatial grains, but find that the former consistently provides a better fit to the data. In our case study, the effect of species richness on the slope SARs appears to be scale dependent, being negative at local scales but positive at regional scales. In univariate tests, the slope of the SAR correlates negatively with human population density and environmental energy availability, and positively with the rate of increase in habitat heterogeneity. We conducted two sets of multiple regression analyses, with and without species richness as a predictor. When species richness is included it exerts a dominant effect, but when it is excluded temperature has the dominant effect on the slope of the SAR, and the effects of other predictors are marginal.

J	Gottschalk, TK; Ekschmitt, K; Bairlein, F				Gottschalk, Thomas K.; Ekschmitt, Klemens; Bairlein, Franz			Relationships between vegetation and bird community composition in grasslands of the Serengeti	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						bird community; East African savanna; grassland; species-habitat relationships; territory mapping	AFRICAN SAVANNA; WOODLANDS; FIRE; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; DYNAMICS; AVIFAUNA; PLAINS; IMPACT	The Serengeti-Mara ecosystem holds one of the largest natural grasslands of the world, which is well known for its large herds of mammals. However, the bird community structure of these grasslands has hardly ever been studied. For the first time, a large-scale study on grassland bird communities has been conducted in all typical open grasslands of the Serengeti National Park. We used ten grassland plots representing a gradient of increasing vegetation height and also including shrubs and trees to analyse the influence of vegetation structure on the composition of grassland bird communities. Three communities of breeding birds were identified in relation to (a) short grass, (b) intermediate and long grass and (c) wooded grasslands. The bird communities of intermediate, long and wooded grassland were very similar, because of identical dominant bird species. Our results suggest that breeding birds of East African grasslands exhibit two contrasting habitat relationships: (1) birds that are restricted to short grass, and (2) species that are tolerant to vegetational shifts from intermediate grass via long grass to early stages of woody vegetation. Because the vegetation is often driven beyond this range in managed tropical grasslands through high grazing pressure or through shrub encroachment, we expect that the long-grass bird communities will not generally resist anthropogenic disturbance.

Frequency-dependence stabilizes competitive interactions among four annual plants	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						annual grassland; California; coexistence; frequency dependence; functional equivalence; neutral theory; niche theory	NEUTRAL THEORY; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; REPLACEMENT SERIES; COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; FEEDBACK; NICHE; SIZE	It is the combination of large fitness differences and strong stabilizing mechanisms that often constitute niche-based explanations for species abundance patterns. Despite the importance of this assumption to much of community ecology, empirical evidence is surprisingly limited. Empirical tests are critical because many abundance patterns are also consistent with neutral-based alternatives (that assume no fitness differences or stabilization). We quantified interactions of four annual grassland species in two-species mixtures at varying frequencies. We found evidence of strong negative frequency-dependent stabilization, where scaled population growth rates increased with decreasing frequency for all four species. There was also a consistent competitive hierarchy among these species indicative of strong fitness differences that, in most cases, suggested potential competitive exclusion despite the observed strong stabilization.

We established twelve 30-m transects on the sloping rims of each of six Carolina bays in northeastern South Carolina to characterize the community gradient, as well as important environmental factors producing this gradient. Mid-points of the transects were placed on jurisdictional wetland boundaries. Hydrology, soil properties, and plant species composition were measured within these transects. On average, transects included an elevation change of 0.6 m that corresponded with gradients of hydrology, soil properties, and community characteristics. Decreasing surface soil moisture (i.e., fewer flood events) and decreasing soil nutrients were associated with a shift from shrub-bog vegetation with relatively low alpha diversity and prominence of evergreens to a relatively diverse and heterogeneous community characterized by grasses, herbs, low shrubs, and vines. Ecotones, identified by abrupt changes in community composition, were more frequently found outside jurisdictional wetland boundaries. Likewise, five near-endemic and endemic plant species were found outside the wetland boundaries.

At large spatial scales, concurrence between patterns of richness, rarity, and composition of species and higher taxa is generally high. Only a few researchers, however, have examined this relationship at the local scale, which is frequently the relevant scale in land-use conflicts. We investigated the reliability of the higher-taxon approach in assessing patterns of species richness, rarity, and composition at the local scale. We studied diversity patterns of three commonly used surrogate taxa: vascular plants, ground-dwelling beetles, and moths. We conducted year-round field surveys for these taxa in the Jerusalem Mountains and the Judean foothills, Israel. Richness and composition of species were highly correlated with richness and composition of genera for all taxa. At the family level, correlations with richness and composition of species were much lower. Excluding monotypic genera and families did not affect these relations. Rarity representation based on higher taxa varied considerably depending on the taxon, and rarity scale and was weaker compared with richness and composition representation. Cumulative richness curves of species and genera showed similar patterns, leveling off at equivalent sampling efforts. Genus-level assessments were a reliable surrogate for local patterns of species richness, rarity, and composition, but family-level assessments performed poorly. The advantage of using coarse taxonomic scales in local diversity surveys is that it may decrease identification time and the need for experts, but it will not reduce sampling effort.

Risk-disturbance overrides density dependence in a hunted colonial rodent, the black-tailed prairie dog Cynomys ludovicianus	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						Allee effect; coloniality; density dependence; hunting; prairie dog; risk-disturbance; Wyoming	GREATER SNOW GEESE; HUNTING DISTURBANCE; ADRENAL ACTIVITY; PREDATION RISK; SPRING HUNT; POPULATION; SCIURIDAE; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; SURVIVAL	Traditional understanding of how hunting affects vertebrate populations emphasizes competitive release and density dependence of vital rates, but more recent thinking has proposed complex non-lethal responses to hunting disturbance and predation risk. Colonial species have been proposed to be more vulnerable than dispersed, solitary species to disturbance and perceived risk from hunting. However, empirical comparisons of density dependence vs. risk disturbance in hunted species are few. To compare density dependence with risk-disturbance effects of hunting on individuals and populations of a colonial species, we tested the response of black-tailed prairie dogs Cynomys ludovicianus to shooting in a before-after, treatment-control experiment. We subjected five colonies to a pulse of shooting, and compared individual and colony attributes to those of five control colonies, protected from shooting. Surviving prairie dogs increased alert behaviours eightfold and reduced both above-ground activity and time spent foraging by 66%. Changes in behaviour lowered the body condition of surviving adults by 35%. Survivors of shooting, especially juveniles, exhibited elevated stress levels; faecal corticosterone concentrations increased by 80% among juveniles. Unexpectedly, overwinter survival rates did not increase in response to reduced prairie dog density. Colonies subjected to shooting experienced reproductive near-collapse the summer after shooting; pregnancy rates declined by 50% and reproductive output fell by 82%. Risk-disturbance overwhelmed any possible density-dependent effects of shooting in prairie dogs, which exhibited additive mortality in response to hunting, and reproductive failure 1 year after shooting. Risk-disturbance was the predominant mechanism whereby individuals and colonies were affected by hunting. Synthesis and applications. Because of their coloniality, prairie dogs possess certain life-history traits that predisposed them to be particularly susceptible to hunting-associated disturbances, which had cascading effects on population-level processes. Our findings contradict the general belief that small-bodied mammals quickly rebound from hunting exploitation via compensatory mortality and reproduction. Managers should consider measures to reduce recreational shooting intensity and duration in regions where black-tailed prairie dog colony growth and persistence is desired, yet allow shooting in areas where colonies conflict with landowner interests.

Disentangling community patterns of nestedness and species co-occurrence	OIKOS			English	Article							NULL MODEL ANALYSIS; DIAMOND,J.M. ASSEMBLY RULES; PRESENCE-ABSENCE MATRICES; META-COMMUNITY; TEMPERATURE; SUBSETS; RANDOMIZATION; DISTRIBUTIONS; RETHINKING; ALGORITHMS	Two opposing patterns of meta-community organization are nestedness and negative species co-occurrence. Both patterns can be quantified with metrics that are applied to presence-absence matrices and tested with null model analysis. Previous meta-analyses have given conflicting results, with the same set of matrices apparently showing high nestedness (Wright et al. 1998) and negative species co-occurrence (Gotelli and McCabe 2002). We clarified the relationship between nestedness and co-occurrence by creating random matrices, altering them systematically to increase or decrease the degree of nestedness or co-occurrence, and then testing the resulting patterns with null models. Species co-occurrence is related to the degree of nestedness, but the sign of the relationship depends on how the test matrices were created. Low-fill matrices created by simple, uniform sampling generate negative correlations between nestedness and co-occurrence: negative species co-occurrence is associated with disordered matrices. However, high-fill matrices created by passive sampling generate the opposite pattern: negative species co-occurrence is associated with highly nested matrices. The patterns depend on which index of species co-occurrence is used, and they are not symmetric: systematic changes in the co-occurrence structure of a matrix are only weakly associated with changes in the pattern of nestedness. In all analyses, the fixed-fixed null model that preserves matrix row and column totals has lower type I and type II error probabilities than an equiprobable null model that relaxes row and column totals. The latter model is part of the popular nestedness temperature calculator, which detects nestedness too frequently in random matrices (type I statistical error). When compared to a valid null model, a matrix with negative species co-occurrence may be either highly nested or disordered, depending on the biological processes that determine row totals (number of species occurrences) and column totals (number of species per site).

Seasonal effects on recolonization of macrobenthos in defaunated sediment: A series of field experiments	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						defaunated sediment; macrobenthos; recolonization; seasonal effects	SOFT-BOTTOM COMMUNITY; TEMPORAL VARIATION; ESTUARINE INFAUNA; SUCCESSION; DISTURBANCE; RESPONSES; BENTHOS; COLONIZATION; ORGANIZATION; RECRUITMENT	A series of experiments was carried out to investigate seasonal effects on rnacrobenthic recolonization in defaunated sediment. Trays with defaunated sediment were deployed sub-tidally at a clean site in Hong Kong in spring, summer, autumn and winter, and five replicates were sampled each month after each deployment. Both abundance and species number in defaunated sediment varied significantly with season, with highest values found in summer and lowest values in winter. Species cornposition in both initial and subsequent months was highly dependant on the time when the sediment was first made available for benthic recolonization, rather than on dominant species that were presented in the natural communities. Results of this study suggest that timing of initial colonization may be more important than life history traits of benthic species, and may play a key role in determining the subsequent succession of macrobenthic communities in sub-tropical waters. It appears that initial recolonization may depend largely on the availability and ability of species to colonize the sediment and establish themselves through competition, whereas abundances of species in the ambient environment play a secondary role.

A comparison of altitudinal species richness patterns of bryophytes with other plant groups in Nepal, Central Himalaya	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						altitudinal gradient; bryophytes; elevational gradient; endemism; Himalaya; liverworts; mid-domain effect; mosses; Rapoport's elevational rule; species richness	ELEVATION GRADIENT; DIVERSITY PATTERNS; VASCULAR PLANTS; RAPOPORTS RULE; EAST HIMALAYA; RANGE; LOPHOZIACEAE; JUNGERMANNIALES; EXTENSIONS; LIVERWORT	Aim To explore species richness patterns in liverworts and mosses along a central Himalayan altitudinal gradient in Nepal (100-5500 m a.s.l.) and to compare these patterns with patterns observed for ferns and flowering plants. We also evaluate the potential importance of Rapoport's elevational rule in explaining the observed richness patterns for liverworts and mosses. Location Nepal, Central Himalaya. Methods We used published data on the altitudinal ranges of over 840 Nepalese mosses and liverworts to interpolate presence between maximum and minimum recorded elevations, thereby giving estimates of species richness for 100-m altitudinal bands. These were compared with previously published patterns for ferns and flowering plants, derived in the same way. Rapoport's elevational rule was assessed by correlation analyses and the statistical significance of the observed correlations was evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations. Results There are strong correlations between richness of the four groups of plants. A humped, unimodal relationship between species richness and altitude was observed for both liverworts and mosses, with maximum richness at 2800 m and 2500 m, respectively. These peaks contrast with the richness peak of ferns at 1900 m and of vascular plants, which have a plateau in species richness between 1500 and 2500 m. Endemic liverworts have their maximum richness at 3300 m, whereas non-endemic liverworts show their maximum richness at 2700 m. The proportion of endemic species is highest at about 4250 m. There is no support from Nepalese mosses for Rapoport's elevational rule. Despite a high correlation between altitude and elevational range for Nepalese liverworts, results from null simulation models suggest that no clear conclusions can be made about whether liverworts support Rapoport's elevational rule. Main conclusions Different demands for climatic variables such as available energy and water may be the main reason for the differences between the observed patterns for the four plant groups. The mid-domain effect may explain part of the observed pattern in moss and liverwort richness but it probably only works as a modifier of the main underlying relationship between climate and species richness.

Identifying new buffer areas for conserving waterbirds in the Mediterranean basin: the importance of the rice fields in Extremadura, Spain	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						anthropogenic habitats; Black-tailed godwit; common crane; East atlantic flyway; rice fields; shorebirds; waterbirds	CLIMATE-CHANGE; HABITAT LOSS; FRANCE; COMMUNITIES; RICEFIELDS; CAMARGUE; REGION; IMPACT	The impact of wetland loss on migratory waterbirds can be mitigated by the presence of anthropogenic habitats such as rice fields. In the Mediterranean basin, wetlands have been drained and altered to such a degree that their very existence is threatened. It is, therefore, essential to identify key buffer areas in the basin to develop conservation strategies for migratory waterbirds. In Extremadura, continental SW Spain, 30,000 ha of new rice fields have created since the 1960s. The present study describes for the first time the waterbird community associated with these inland rice fields, and addresses the question of the potential value of this area in buffering the loss of natural wetlands for populations of waterbirds using the East Atlantic Flyway (EAF). The waterbird community studied consisted of 45 species, with population levels reaching values of international importance (> 1% of the biogeographical population using EAF) for the Common Crane Grus grus (19%), Black-tailed Godwit Limosa limosa (1.2%), Black-winged Stilt Himantopus himantopus (1.2%), and Cattle Egret Bubulcus ibis (1%). The presence of these rice fields may be modifying the wintering and/or feeding sites of some waterbird species such as the Common Crane and Black-tailed Godwit. Unfortunately, there is no legal protection for this area. We propose the designation of these rice fields as a Special Protection Area for birds.

J	Soininen, J; Lennon, JJ; Hillebrand, H				Soininen, Janne; Lennon, Jack J.; Hillebrand, Helmut			A multivariate analysis of beta diversity across organisms and environments	ECOLOGY			English	Article						latitudinal gradients; macroecology; species-area relationships; species richness; species turnover	SPECIES-AREA RELATIONSHIPS; SPATIAL-TURNOVER; LATITUDINAL GRADIENTS; REGIONAL PROCESSES; BODY-SIZE; SCALE; RICHNESS; ECOLOGY; COMMUNITIES; PATTERN	We examined variability in hierarchical beta diversity across ecosystems, geographical gradients, and organism groups using multivariate spatial mixed modeling analysis of two independent data sets. The larger data set comprised reported ratios of regional species richness (RSR) to local species richness (LSR) and the second data set consisted of RSR: LSR ratios derived from nested species-area relationships. There was a negative, albeit relatively weak, relationship between beta diversity and latitude. We found only relatively subtle differences in beta diversity among the realms, yet beta diversity was lower in marine systems than in terrestrial or freshwater realms. Beta diversity varied significantly among organisms' major characteristics such as body mass, trophic position, and dispersal type in the larger data set. Organisms that disperse via seeds had highest beta diversity, and passively dispersed organisms showed the lowest beta diversity. Furthermore, autotrophs had lower beta diversity than organisms higher up the food web; omnivores and carnivores had consistently higher beta diversity. This is evidence that beta diversity is simultaneously controlled by extrinsic factors related to geography and environment, and by intrinsic factors related to organism characteristics.

Observations thereof serve as the impetus for many ecological endeavors. Many of the species now known to dominate ecosystem functioning were largely ignored until studies of those underappreciated species elucidated their critical roles. Recognizing the potential importance of underappreciated species has implications for functional redundancies in ecosystems and should alter our approach to long-term monitoring. One example of an applied ecological system containing species shifts, underappreciated species, and potential changes in functional redundancies is the topic of fisheries. The demersal component of many fish communities usually consists of high-profile and commercially valuable species that are targets of fisheries, plus a diverse group of lesser known species that have minimal commercial value and focus. Yet ecologically these traditionally nontargeted species are often a major biomass sink in marine ecosystems and can also be critical in the functioning of bentho-demersal food webs. I examined the biomass trajectories of several species of skates, cottids, lophiids, anarhichadids, zooarcids, and similar species in the northeast U.S. Atlantic ecosystem to determine whether their relative abundance has changed across the past four decades. Distribution and stomach contents of these species were also evaluated over time to further elucidate the relative importance of these species. Landings of these underappreciated bentho-demersal fish were also examined in comparison to those species that historically have been commercially targeted. Of particular emphasis was the evaluation of evidence for sequential stock depletion and the ramifications for functional redundancy for this ecosystem. Results indicate that some of these fish species are now the dominant piscivores, benthivores, and scavengers in this ecosystem. These formerly under-studied species generally have either maintained a consistent population size or have increased in abundance (and expanded in distribution) over the past several decades. Nontraditionally targeted fish species are an often overlooked but important component of bentho-deiriersal fish communities. Implications for the energy flow and resilience specifically for future fisheries and generally for harvesting biological resources are significant, remaining critical issues for the world's ecosystems.

J	Wallace, KJ				Wallace, Ken J.			Classification of ecosystem services: Problems and solutions	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Review						biodiversity planning; ecosystem services; natural resource management; decision-making values	BIODIVERSITY; VALUATION; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; ECONOMICS; ECOLOGY; RESOURCES; DIVERSITY; SYSTEMS	Ecosystem values are not well accounted for in decisions concerning natural resources. in this context, the concept of ecosystem services offers an important opportunity to develop a framework to underpin the wise use of biodiversity and other natural resources. Although the merit of using ecosystem services to frame biodiversity evaluations has been documented, the classification systems employed mix processes (means) for achieving services and the services themselves (ends) within the same classification category. This limits their contribution to decisions concerning biodiversity. Ambiguity in the definitions of key terms - such as ecosystem processes, functions and services - exacerbates this situation. After clarifying definitions and discussing the basic components of an effective typology, this paper develops a classification of ecosystem services that. provides a framework for decisions in natural resource management. However, further work is still required to resolve particular issues, such as the classification of socio-cultural services. Although science can contribute to effective decisions by clearly classifying services and describing their links to processes, final decisions concerning biodiversity and other natural resources are inevitably socio-political, and embedded within a particular cultural context.

J	Guldemond, R; van Aarde, R				Guldemond, Robert; van Aarde, Rudi			The impact of elephants on plants and their community variables in South Africa's Maputaland	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						abundance; composition; density; incidence; rank; turnover	SPECIES ABUNDANCE PATTERNS; NATIONAL-PARK; WOODY VEGETATION; REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION; NEUTRAL THEORY; SAVANNA; DISTRIBUTIONS; FIRE; HYPOTHESIS; WOODLANDS	Elephants confined to protected areas could affect co-occurring species. We expected measurable deviations in the density, species number, turnover and composition, abundance-incidence and rank-abundance patterns of woody plant communities where elephants browse. We examined these variables in the presence (inside South Africa's Tembe Elephant Park) and absence (uninhabited communal land adjacent to the park) of elephants for sand forests, closed and open woodlands. Woodland type influenced the apparent effect of elephants on tree densities and number of species. In sand forests, the presence of elephants was not associated with lowered tree densities but this did not hold for mixed woodlands. The rates of species turnover in the park were consistently higher than on communal land for all three woodland types. Species composition also differed significantly between these areas, as did the number of favoured food trees of elephants. Elephants had a clear influence on vegetation at the species level. However, at the community level they had no apparent affect on woodland-specific abundance-incidences and rank-abundance relationships. Elephants were confined to Tembe for only some 20 years before this study and still occur at relatively low densities. This may explain why we could not detect an impact on the bivariate relationships.

J	Mac Nally, R				Mac Nally, Ralph			Use of the abundance spectrum and relative-abundance distributions to analyze assemblage change in massively altered landscapes	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						dispersal-limited multinomial; habitat fragmentation; nested subsets; relative-abundance distributions; zero-sum multinomial	SPECIES-AREA RELATIONSHIP; UNIFIED NEUTRAL THEORY; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; DENSITY-DEPENDENCE; EUCALYPT FORESTS; CENTRAL VICTORIA; EXTINCTION DEBT; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION	Fragmentation of natural landscapes is a pervasive process in the world. Common models predict coherent change in assemblages, with less numerous species becoming locally extinct first, then species of intermediate abundance, and so forth. Relative-abundance distributions should change systematically in landscapes characterized by greater change. Such a predictable sequence of change is not evident in the avifaunas of landscapes of central Victoria, Australia, where relative-abundance patterns in more affected landscapes bear little resemblance to reference distributions. I provide two sets of analyses of relative-abundance distributions: ( 1) analyses that do not depend on the identity of individual species and ( 2) abundance spectra, which use ordered lists of species ranked by species' commonness in reference systems. While abundance spectra change dramatically in smaller remnants, relative-abundance distributions change little, suggesting that the "reorganization" of abundances occurs over ecological time frames. The dispersal-limited multinomial is a flexible distribution that may fit many data sets yet be unrelated to assumptions ( species neutrality) and processes ( fixed total numbers of individuals) of the unified neutral theory. A more complete understanding of human impacts at landscape scales must include capacities to predict those species that will be advantaged by change, as well as those that will be disadvantaged.

J	Miller, JR; Hobbs, RJ				Miller, James R.; Hobbs, Richard J.			Habitat restoration - Do we know what we're doing?	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Review						financial constraints; goal setting; limiting resources; prioritization; social constraints; target species	ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WILDLIFE; LANDSCAPES; SCIENCE; BIRDS; FRAGMENTATION; ECOSYSTEMS; PRINCIPLES	The term "habitat restoration" appears frequently in conservation and landscape management documents but is often poorly articulated. There is a need to move to a clearer and more systematic approach to habitat restoration that considers appropriate goals linked to target species or suites of species, as well as the ecological, financial, and social constraints on what is possible. Recommendations for particular courses of action need to be prioritized so that restoration activities can achieve the best result possible within these constraints. There is unlikely to be a generic set of recommendations that is applicable everywhere because actions need to be matched to the particulars of site and situation. However, there is a generic set of questions that can be asked, which can help guide the process of deciding which restoration actions are most important and contribute most to the reestablishment of desirable habitat characteristics within a given project area.

Assembly rules of ground-foraging ant assemblages are contingent on disturbance, habitat and spatial scale	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						coexistence; community structure; disturbance; fire; Formicidae; niche partitioning; Siskiyou Mountains	SPECIES COOCCURRENCE; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; BUMBLEBEE COMMUNITIES; FIELD EXPERIMENTS; SANTA-ROSALIA; COCOA FARMS; DESERT ANTS; NULL MODEL; COMPETITION; DIVERSITY	Aim A major endeavour of community ecology is documenting non-random patterns in the composition and body size of coexisting species, and inferring the processes, or assembly rules, that may have given rise to the observed patterns. Such assembly rules include species sorting resulting from interspecific competition, aggregation at patchily distributed resources, and co-evolutionary dynamics. However, for any given taxon, relatively little is known about how these patterns and processes change through time and vary with habitat type, disturbance history, and spatial scale. Here, we tested for non-random patterns of species co-occurrence and body size in assemblages of ground-foraging ants and asked whether those patterns varied with habitat type, disturbance history, and spatial scale. Location Burned and unburned forests and fens in the Siskiyou Mountains of southern Oregon and northern California, USA. Methods We describe ground-foraging ant assemblages sampled over two years in two discrete habitat types, namely Darlingtonia fens and upland forests. Half of these sites had been subject to a large-scale, discrete disturbance - a major fire - in the year prior to our first sample. We used null model analyses to compare observed species co-occurrence patterns and body-size distributions in these assemblages with randomly generated assemblages unstructured by competition both within (i.e. at a local spatial scale) and among (i.e. at a regional scale) sites. Results At local spatial scales, species co-occurrence patterns and body-size ratios did not differ from randomness. At regional scales, co-occurrence patterns were random or aggregated, and there was evidence for constant body-size ratios of forest ants. Although these patterns varied between habitats and years, they did not differ between burned and unburned sites. Main conclusions Our results suggest that the operation of assembly rules depends on spatial scale and habitat type, but that it was not affected by disturbance history from fire.

J	Waldron, A				Waldron, Anthony			Null models of geographic range size evolution reaffirm its heritability	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						clade selection; macroecology; comparative method; speciation; diversification	SPECIES-LEVEL; BODY-SIZE; PLEISTOCENE MAMMALS; LIFE-HISTORY; SPECIATION; EXTINCTION; ECOLOGY; BIRDS; DIVERSIFICATION; MACROEVOLUTION	Most models of allopatric speciation predict that the two daughter species will have range sizes different from each other's and potentially from that of their common ancestor. However, I find that this difference is less than that expected under a variety of null models of ran-e evolution. Sister species' range values may therefore become more similar in the time following speciation. Greater-than-expected similarity (symmetry) has also been treated as a form of range size heritability therefore compare the results of this symmetry approach to a test for phylogenetic signal, using the range sizes of North American birds. I find that range size is heritable under both tests. I suggest that null models for range size heritability should be informed by an explicit model of evolution. Comparative methods may give erroneous results if they fail to take the unusual form of inheritance of range size into account.

Using a macroecological approach our study aimed at identifying the important environmental gradients for spiders. We generated numerical values of niche position and niche width. We also investigated relationships between these niche properties as well as the degree of phylogenetic conservatism in order to draw conclusions about the evolution of the habitat niche. Location Central Europe: lowlands of Austria, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Methods We analysed 244 published spider communities from 70 habitat types by correspondence analysis. The resulting community scores were used to test for correlations with habitat characteristics. Species scores were used to derive niche position (mean scores) and niche width (standard deviation of scores). To test for niche conservatism we estimated variance components across the taxonomic hierarchy. Results The first two axes of the correspondence analysis were correlated with shading and moisture, respectively. Niche width had a hump-shaped relationship to both environmental gradients. beta-diversity was strikingly higher in open habitats than in forests. Habitat niche conservatism was lower than phylogenetic conservatism in body size. Main conclusions Environmental factors are important drivers for the beta-diversity of spiders, especially across open habitats. This underlines the importance of preserving the whole range of moisture conditions in open habitats. Narrow niches of species occurring at the ends of both environmental gradients indicate that adaptations to extreme habitats lead to constraints in ecological flexibility. Nevertheless, the habitat niche of species seems to evolve much faster than morphological or physiological traits.

Dietary overlap of swift foxes and coyotes in northwestern Texas	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST			English	Article							JOAQUIN KIT FOXES; WESTERN KANSAS; FOOD-HABITS; RED FOXES; SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS; INTRAGUILD PREDATION; VULPES VELOX; COMPETITION; POPULATION; CARNIVORES	Predation by coyotes (Canis latrans) has been documented as the main cause of mortality in most populations of swift foxes (Vulpes velox), although reasons for such high predation rates were often unclear. Additionally, coyotes kill but generally do not consume swift foxes suggesting coyotes kill for reasons other than food. To better understand ecological relationships between these species, we studied dietary overlap of syntopic coyotes and swift foxes in northwestern Texas from 1998 to 2000. Both species consumed the same food items and had similar seasonal changes in diets, although the order of these items differed for each species. Overall, coyotes and swift foxes had high dietary overlap (Ro = 0.856), although some dietary partitioning was evident based on food size categories. Dietary overlap was least in summer (Ro = 0.714) and greatest in winter (Ro = 0.859). Swift fox diets were dominated by small food items (i.e., rodents and insects), whereas coyote diets had nearly equal representation of all food classes. The similarity in diets between coyotes and swift foxes indicated the potential for resource competition between these species, although we did not determine food availability. Regardless, the killing and spatial displacement of swift foxes by coyotes throughout their distribution might be due to their high food resource overlap, especially because coyote populations tend to be limited by prey availability.

Conflicts between coyotes and humans are an increasing concern for managers in urban areas. We examined the spatial and temporal utilization and availability of natural and human-associated food for coyotes in the Chicago metropolitan area, Illinois, USA. We collected 1429 coyote scats from May 2000 to December 2002, and conducted prey surveys in 2002, in 4 sites that varied in their degree of urban development. Dominant food items included small rodents, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), fruit, eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus) and birds. Their availability and occurrence in scats varied among sites and seasons. The occurrence of human-associated food items, which was only found in significant amounts in the most developed site, varied seasonally (2-25%). Because coyotes in less-developed areas had lower dietary diversity, these coyotes may have to venture into developed areas when there is a decline in the abundance of major prey species for that specific area.

J	Mouillot, D; Mason, NWH; Wilson, JB				Mouillot, David; Mason, Norman W. H.; Wilson, J. Bastow			Is the abundance of species determined by their functional traits? A new method with a test using plant communities	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						competition; environmental filtering; functional niche; nearest-neighbour; New Zealand	ASSEMBLY RULES; LIMITING SIMILARITY; CONVERGENCE; ECOLOGY; COEXISTENCE; COMPETITION; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; TEXTURE; MODEL	The relation between functional traits and abundance of species has the potential to provide evidence on the mechanisms that structure local ecological communities. The niche-limitation/limiting-similarity hypothesis, derived from MacArthur and Levins' original concept, predicts that species that are similar to others in terms of functional traits will suffer greater competition and hence be less abundant. On the other hand, the environment-filtering/ habitat-optimum hypothesis predicts that groups of species with functional traits that are close to the optimum for that environment, and are therefore similar to other species, will be more abundant. We propose a new niche-assembly model for predicting the relative abundance of species in communities from their functional traits, which can detect the patterns that would be expected from either of these hypotheses. The model was fitted to eight plant communities sampled in the Lake Ohau district of New Zealand. For seven of the sites, the patterns could not be distinguished from that expected under a null model. However, in one site there was highly significant departure from the null model in the direction expected from the niche-limitation hypothesis. The site was probably the most productive of those examined. It is possible that competition for light rather than belowground resources, or faster recovery from disturbance, allowed greater predictability. Surprisingly, the predictability was seen when just the presences of a species' neighbours in trait space were taken into account, but not when the potential effects of those neighbours were weighted by their abundance. For three of the four model types, the effects of species on each other were consistently negative: a significant trend. These results contradict the various neutral models of ecological communities.

Human disturbance affects habitat use and behaviour of Asiatic leopard Panthera pardus in Kaeng Krachan National Park, Thailand	ORYX			English	Article						Asiatic leopard; carnivore; human disturbance; Panthera pardus; protected area management; Thailand	PREY POPULATIONS; PROTECTED AREAS; ROADS; TIGERS; DENSITIES; WILDLIFE; MAMMALS	Edge effects arising from road construction and other development in protected areas can negatively affect the behaviour of wildlife, particularly large carnivores. The Asiatic leopard Panthera pardus is a large carnivore that may be sensitive to edge effects. Camera trapping was used to assess the influence of human disturbance along forest edges on leopard behaviour and habitat use in a 104 km(2) area of Kaeng Krachan National Park, Thailand. A minimum of four male and two female leopards was recorded in the study area. A Park access road bisecting the study area was not a barrier to leopard movement but movements and activity were affected by human traffic inside the Park. A regression model showed that leopard habitat use increased with distance from human settlements at the forest edge. As in other parts of its range, leopards at Kaeng Krachan National Park tended to show less diurnal activity in areas more heavily used by people compared to areas less used. As is the case with tigers, such responses may pose a threat to leopard population persistence but more research is needed to determine the demographic implications of edge effects for Asiatic leopards and other large tropical carnivores, and the appropriate mitigation strategies required.

It initially appeared that genetic data resolved the basic models of recent human evolution in favor of the "out-of-Africa replacement" hypothesis in which anatomically modern humans evolved in Africa about 150,000 years ago, started to spread throughout the world about 100,000 years ago, and subsequently drove to complete genetic extinction (replacement) all other human populations in Eurasia. Unfortunately, many of the genetic studies on recent human evolution have suffered from scientific flaws, including misrepresenting the models of recent human evolution, focusing upon hypothesis compatibility rather than hypothesis testing, committing the ecological fallacy, and failing to consider a broader array of alternative hypotheses. Once these flaws are corrected, there is actually little genetic support for the out-of-Africa replacement hypothesis. Indeed, when genetic data are used in a hypothesis-testing framework, the out-of-Africa replacement hypothesis is strongly rejected. The model of recent human evolution that emerges from a statistical hypothesis-testing framework does not correspond to any of the traditional models of human evolution, but it is compatible with fossil and archaeological data. These studies also reveal that any one gene or DNA region captures only a small part of human evolutionary history, so multilocus studies are essential. As more and more loci became available, genetics will undoubtedly offer additional insights and resolutions of human evolution.

ASSEMBLY RULES; PRESENCE-ABSENCE MATRICES; COOCCURRENCE; COLONIZATION; COMMUNITIES; SUBSETS; RANDOMIZATION; METAANALYSIS; TEMPERATURE; COMPETITION	Nestedness is a common biogeographic pattern in which small communities form proper subsets of large communities. However, the detection of nestedness in binary presence-absence matrices will be affected by both the metric used to quantify nestedness and the reference null distribution. In this study, we assessed the statistical performance of eight nestedness metrics and six null model algorithms. The metrics and algorithms were tested against a benchmark set of 200 random matrices and 200 nested matrices that were created by passive sampling. Many algorithms that have been used in nestedness studies are vulnerable to type I errors (falsely rejecting a true null hypothesis). The best-performing algorithm maintains fixed row and fixed column totals, but it is conservative and may not always detect nestedness when it is present. Among the eight indices, the popular matrix temperature metric did not have good statistical properties. Instead, the Brualdi and Sanderson discrepancy index and Cutler's index of unexpected presences performed best. When used with the fixed-fixed algorithm, these indices provide a conservative test for nestedness. Although previous studies have revealed a high frequency of nestedness, a reanalysis of 288 empirical matrices suggests that the true frequency of nested matrices is between 10% and 40%.

We evaluate the hypothesis that this asymmetry results from the distribution of abundance among species, so that species interactions occur randomly among individuals. We used a database on mutualistic and antagonistic bipartite quantitative interaction networks. We show that across all types of networks asymmetry was correlated with abundance, so that rare species were asymmetrically affected by their abundant partners, while pairs of interacting abundant species tended to exhibit more symmetric, reciprocally strong effects. A null model shows that abundance provides a sufficient explanation of the asymmetry structure in some networks, but suggests the role of additional factors in others. Although not universal, our hypothesis holds for a substantial fraction of networks analyzed here, and should be considered as a null model in all studies aimed at evaluating the ecological and evolutionary consequences of species interactions.

J	Cielo, R; Gneri, MA; Martins, FR				Cielo-Filho, Roque; Gneri, Mario Antonio; Martins, Fernando Roberto			Position on slope, disturbance, and tree species coexistence in a Seasonal Semideciduous Forest in SE Brazil	PLANT ECOLOGY			English	Article						environmental heterogeneity; diversity; neutral theory; topography	SOUTH-EASTERN BRAZIL; 2 SPATIAL PROCESSES; RAIN-FOREST; RECRUITMENT LIMITATION; TROPICAL FORESTS; CANOPY GAPS; ECOLOGY; SOIL; TOPOGRAPHY; DIVERSITY	We investigated the influence of position on a slope (plot relative elevation) and vegetation disturbance (the tallest tree height per plot) on community composition and diversity in a SE Brazilian Seasonal Semideciduous Forest (46 degrees 55' W, 22 degrees 50' S). Trees with dbh >= 5 cm were sampled in one hundred 10 x 10 m plots randomly placed in a 6.5-ha stand. Through partial Mantel test, floristic dissimilarities among plots (Jaccard index computed with species abundance in each plot) were correlated with environmental distances among plots (Euclidian distance index computed with relative elevation and the tallest tree height values in each plot). Relative elevation and the tallest tree per plot height were individually correlated with floristic gradients expressed by PCA axes scores using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Through resampling, we compared diversity (richness, Berger-Parker D and Shannon H') among plots in the drier (up) and moister (low) ends of the slope. Floristic dissimilarities were significantly correlated with environmental distances even after geographic distances among plots have been partialled out (r (m) = 0.1274, p < 0.001). The first two PCA axes accounted for 22% of the total variance. After Bonferroni and Dutilleul's corrections, axis 1 showed a marginally significant correlation with plot relative elevation (r = -0.4097, p = 0.0309), and axis 2 was significantly correlated with the tallest tree height per plot (r = 0.2953, p = 0.0106). Position on the slope and vegetation disturbance were reliable predictors of community composition, thus suggesting the operation of niche assembly organizing processes. Richness and diversity (H') decreased and dominance (D) increased with elevation on the slope. Dominance increase from D ((300)) = 0.11 (confidence interval = 0.091-0.131) to D ((300)) = 0.19 (CI = 0.165-0.210) surpassed the expected dominance increase based on the reduction of richness alone: D-(300) = 0.13 (CI = 0.110-0.140), thus highlighting the niche partitioning assembly of the community, especially among abundant species. Given the great amount of floristic variability remaining unexplained, stochastic processes, such as those related to dispersal limitation, may also have influence on the community composition. Therefore, both niche assembly and chance events can operate even on a fine local scale.

Assessment of elk highway permeability by using Global Positioning System telemetry	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Arizona; Cervus elaphus; elk; Global Positioning System; highway crossings; movements; passage rates; permeability; telemetry; wildlife-vehicle collisions	DEER-VEHICLE COLLISIONS; WOODLAND CARIBOU; ROADS; HABITAT; WILDLIFE; PERFORMANCE; AVOIDANCE; MOVEMENTS; SELECTION; ALBERTA	Highways have significant direct and indirect impact on natural ecosystems, including wildlife barrier and fragmentation effects, resulting in diminished habitat connectivity and highway permeability. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) telemetry to assess Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) permeability across a 30-km stretch of highway in central Arizona, USA, currently being reconstructed with 11 wildlife underpasses, 6 bridges, and associated ungulate-proof fencing. The highway was reconstructed in phases, allowing for comparison of highway crossing and passage rates during various stages of reconstruction. We instrumented 33 elk (25 F, 8 M) with GPS receiver collars May 2002 to April 2004. Our collars accrued 101,506 GPS fixes with 45% occurring within 1 km of the highway. Nearly 2 times the proportion of fixes occurred within 1 km of the highway compared with random. We think elk were attracted to the highway corridor by riparian-meadow foraging habitats that were 7 times more concentrated within the 1-km zone around the highway compared with the mean proportion within elk use areas encompassing all GPS fixes. Elk crossed the highway 3,057 times; crossing frequency and distribution along the highway were aggregated compared with random. Crossing frequency within 0.16-km highway segments was negatively associated with the distance to riparian-meadow habitats (r(s) = -0.714, n = 190, P < 0.001). Mean observed crossing frequency (92.6 +/- 23.5 [SE] crossings/elk) was lower than random (149.6 +/- 27.6 crossings/elk). Females crossed 4.5 times as frequently as males. Highway permeability among reconstruction classes was assessed using passage rates (ratio of highway crossings to approaches); our overall mean passage rate was 0.67 +/- 0.08 crossings per approach. The mean passage rate for elk crossing the highway section where reconstruction was completed (0.43 +/- 0.15 crossings/approach) was half that of sections under reconstruction and control sections combined (0.86 +/- 0.09 crossings/approach). Permeability was jointly influenced by the size of the widened highway and associated vehicular traffic on all lanes. Crossing frequency was used to delineate where ungulate-proof fencing yielded maximum benefit in intercepting and funneling crossing elk toward underpasses, promoting highway safety. Use of passage rates provides a quantitative measure to assess permeability, conduct future pre- and postconstruction comparisons, and to develop mitigation strategies to minimize highway impacts to wildlife.

The influence of this land use change on ecological processes is poorly understood. The goal of this paper is to draw on ecological theory to provide a synthetic framework for understanding how land use change around protected areas may alter ecological processes and biodiversity within protected areas and to provide a basis for identifying scientifically based management alternatives. We first present a conceptual model of protected areas embedded within larger ecosystems that often include surrounding human land use. Drawing on case studies in this Invited Feature, we then explore a comprehensive set of ecological mechanisms by which land use on surrounding lands may influence ecological processes and biodiversity within reserves. These mechanisms involve changes in ecosystem size, with implications for minimum dynamic area, species-area effect, and trophic structure; altered flows of materials and disturbances into and out of reserves; effects on crucial habitats for seasonal and migration movements and population source/sink dynamics; and exposure to humans through hunting, poaching, exotics species, and disease. These ecological mechanisms provide a basis for assessing the vulnerability of protected areas to land use. They also suggest criteria for designing regional management to sustain protected areas in the context of surrounding human land use. These design criteria include maximizing the area of functional habitats, identifying and maintaining ecological process zones, maintaining key migration and source habitats, and managing human proximity and edge effects.

Vascular plant diversity and climate change in the alpine zone of the Lefka Ori, Crete	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						islands; global change; Greece; mountains; species richness; species turnover	ELEVATION GRADIENTS; SPECIES RICHNESS; VEGETATION; MOUNTAINS	The aim of this study is to analyse the vascular flora and the local climate along an altitudinal gradient in the Lefka Ori massif Crete and to evaluate the potential effects of climate change on the plant diversity of the sub-alpine and alpine zones. It provides a quantitative/qualitative analysis of vegetation-environment relationships for four summits along an altitude gradient on the Lefka Ori massif Crete (1664-2339 m). The GLORIA multi-summit approach was used to provide vegetation and floristic data together with temperature records for every summit. Species richness and species turnover was calculated together with floristic similarity between the summits. 70 species were recorded, 20 of which were endemic, belonging to 23 different families. Cretan endemics dominate at these high altitudes. Species richness and turnover decreased with altitude. The two highest summits showed greater floristic similarity. Only 20% of the total flora recorded reaches the highest summit while 10% is common among summits. Overall there was a 4.96 degrees C decrease in temperature along the 675 m gradient. Given a scenario of temperature increase the ecotone between the sub-alpine and alpine zone would be likely to have the greatest species turnover. Southern exposures are likely to be invaded first by thermophilous species while northern exposures are likely to be more resistant to changes. Species distribution shifts will also depend on habitat availability. Many, already threatened, local endemic species will be affected first.

Conservation easements: Biodiversity protection and private use	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						biodiversity protection; conservation easement; land trust; land use; private-land conservation; The Nature Conservancy; working landscape	LAND TRUSTS; AREAS	Conservation easements are one of the primary tools for conserving biodiversity on private land. Despite their increasing use, little quantitative data are available on what species and habitats conservation easements aim to protect, how much structural development they allow, or what types of land use they commonly permit. Too address these knowledge gaps, we surveyed staff responsible for 119 conservation easements established by the largest nonprofit easement holder, The Nature Conservancy, between 1985 and 2004. Most easements (80%) aimed to provide core habitat to protect species or communities on-site, and nearly all were designed to reduce development. Conservation easements also allowed for a wide range of private uses, which may result in additional fragmentation and habitat disturbance. Some residential or commercial use, new structures, or subdivision of the property were permitted on 85% of sampled conservation easements. Over half (56%) allowed some additional buildings, of which 60% restricted structure size or building area. Working landscape easements with ranching, forestry, or farming made up nearly half (46%) of the easement properties sampled and were more likely than easements without these uses to be designated as buffers to enhance biodiversity in the surrounding area. Our results demonstrate the need for clear restrictions on building and subdivision in easements, research on the compatibility of private uses on easement land, and greater public understanding of the trade-offs implicit in the use of conservation easements for biodiversity conservation.

Planning for long, wide conservation corridors on private lands in the Oak Ridges Moraine, Ontario, Canada	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						conservation corridors; conservation legislation; land-use planning; Oak Ridges Moraine; private land		We explored the role of conservation biology in the planning of a natural-heritage system that includes long, wide conservation corridors situated primarily on private lands, and established to connect natural core areas in the Oak Ridges Moraine of Ontario, Canada. We based our review on government documents, semi-structured interviews with participants involved in this land-use planning process, and our involvement with the issue from 1990 through 2002. Conservation biology had a major influence on the outcome of the land-use planning process for this moraine. The landform was identified as an area of value by the environmental movement within the context of a number of ongoing government studies that began in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Conservation biologists and planners in government, the environmental movement, and the private sector carried out work related to conservation biology, including inventories and the development and application of criteria for the delineation of core areas and conservation corridors. Once the political timing was favorable (2001-2002), decision makers linked the science of conservation biology to planning policies and law in Ontario. The Oak Ridges Moraine land-use planning process was precedent setting in Canada, and possibly internationally. To our knowledge this is the first time long, wide conservation corridors on private lands were regulated through land-use-planning legislation and led to restrictions on urban development and aggregate resource extraction.

The models are based on a simple colonization rule operating on a rectangular grid. Two special cases within the class are traditional random placement and negative binomial models. Over three large data sets, these two cases are strongly outperformed by more flexible models within the class, in particular, models that allow more general patterns of aggregation. The models are simple and broadly applicable, with only one adjustable parameter, representing aggregation. Shortcomings of the colonization rule are studied, and extensions and applications of the models are discussed.

Predicting biodiversity change involves understanding not only ecology and evolution, but also complex changes in human societies and economies. Scenarios offer a less rigid approach to thinking about biodiversity change in a policy and management context. They shift the focus of research and management from making singular predictions and developing single 'best' strategies to exploring uncertainties and assessing the outcomes of alternative policies. The four Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) biodiversity scenarios illustrate current approaches to biodiversity estimation in global scenarios. The MA biodiversity scenarios are built around the species-area relationship and the magnitudes of a few area-dependent processes such as nitrogen deposition and climate change. Some of the most obvious landscape-related omissions from the MA scenarios are pattern-process feedbacks, scale dependencies, and the role of landscape configuration. While the MA has set a new standard for biodiversity scenarios, future exercises would benefit from a more multi-scale and more mechanistic framework. I use examples from research on the landscape ecology and biogeography of African ticks to illustrate how a hypothesis-based approach can be used to analyse the multi-scale, multi-level drivers of change in patterns of species occurrences. Two of the most important challenges for the future development of both landscape ecology and biodiversity scenarios are to become more mechanistic (less pattern-based) and more general (applicable across different landscapes).

The tests for clustering and nestedness of the occurrences of species and negative co-occurrence patterns provide four important innovations. Firstly, they are not restricted to the analysis of communities along one-dimensional gradients or to the main axis of variation. Secondly, abundance data can also be considered in the null model whereas most previous approaches could consider only presence/absence data. And thirdly, habitat suitability and spatial autocorrelation can be incorporated in the null model so that patterns that might be caused by biotic interactions can be distinguished from patterns which are the result of differences in the suitability or accessibility of sites for the examined organisms. Finally, the test for nestedness is also appropriate if there is more than one set of nested subsets. A re-analysis of 35 data sets with these tests showed the importance of considering the autocorrelation of the occurrences of species in analyses of meta-community structure and demonstrated the advantage of abundance data for tests of clustering of species. With abundance data it could be shown that there is a significant clustering of species, i.e. there are positive associations of species in most meta-communities, even if an environmentally or spatially constrained null model is used for the test. Co-occurrence patterns that might indicate interspecific competition were found in many of the analysed presence/absence data sets. Surprisingly the analysis of abundance data sets provides less evidence for interspecific competition. A hierarchical organization of communities, i.e. nestedness, turned out to be a rare pattern, if the autocorrelation of the occurrences of species is considered.

The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) was used for patterning and visualizing community patterns of macroinvertebrates collected on the national scale. The SOM accordingly classified the samples to eight groups of communities, and the groups firstly corresponded to the geographical regions of the sampling sites, distinguishing the samples from mountain streams with high species richness from the samples from lowland areas with low species richness. Relations between species richness and abundance showed three patterns according to the SOM groups: (1) high species richness and high abundance in the clean area, (2) intermediate species richness and high abundance in intermediately polluted area, and (3) low species richness and low abundance in severely damaged area. Biological indices (Shannon diversity index, evenness, EPT richness, EPT abundance, and BMWP score) were also accordingly differentiated among the different clusters. The clustered communities were correspondingly related to the patterns of species richness and abundance, and the trained SOM appears to be efficient in defining the patterns of ecoregions.

Habitat type influences fire resilience of ant assemblages in the semi-arid tropics of Northern Australia	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						burning; conservation; disturbance; formicidae; invertebrates; Purnululu National Park	ARID MALLEE REGION; LEAF-CUTTING ANT; SOUTHEASTERN AUSTRALIA; NORTHWESTERN VICTORIA; SAMPLE COVERAGE; AFRICAN SAVANNA; RAIN-FOREST; COMMUNITIES; REGIMES; CONSERVATION	Although fire is an annual occurrence in savanna systems and is widely used as a tool in conservation management, the effects of fire on biodiversity remain poorly understood. This study investigated the response of ant assemblages, a key component of invertebrate diversity, to burning in two dominant savanna ecosystems (spinifex uplands and sandplain) in the Australian semi-arid tropics. A total of 180 pitfall traps were established in each habitat and each sampling period (wet and dry season). We collected a total of 89 046 ants from 18 genera, representing 126 species. The response of ant assemblages to fire varied with habitat type. We relate this response to habitat-specific fire induced differences in microhabitat structure and the vertical distribution of biomass. There were large differences in assemblage composition in the spinifex habitat, where vegetation composition and structure varied considerably between burnt and unburnt sites. In contrast, assemblages were largely resilient to single fire events in the sandplain, where vegetation change following fire was less pronounced. This study highlights the need for conservation managers to be aware of how different habitats respond to fire and what the consequences of different management actions might be.

Layers of varying depths in the Kazan sediments were investigated in terms of (1) chemical parameters and (2) DNA-based microbial population structures. The latter was accomplished by analyzing the sequences of directly amplified 16S rRNA genes, resulting in the phylogenetic analysis of the prokaryotic communities. Sequences of organisms potentially associated with processes such as anaerobic methane oxidation and sulfate reduction were thus identified. Overall, the sediment layers revealed the presence of sequences of quite diverse bacterial and archaeal communities, which varied considerably with depth. Dominant types revealed in these communities are known as key organisms involved in the following processes: (1) anaerobic methane oxidation and sulfate reduction, (2) sulfide oxidation, and (3) a range of (aerobic) heterotrophic processes. In the communities in the lowest sediment layer sampled (22-34 cm), sulfate-reducing bacteria and archaea of the ANME-2 cluster (likely involved in anaerobic methane oxidation) were prevalent, whereas heterotrophic organisms abounded in the top sediment layer (0-6 cm). Communities in the middle layer (6-22 cm) contained organisms that could be linked to either of the aforementioned processes. We discuss how these phylogeny (sequence)-based findings can support the ongoing molecular work aimed at unraveling both the functioning and the functional diversities of the communities under study.

In rivers throughout the world, these processes have been altered by channelization and other anthropogenic stresses. Yet despite increasing awareness of the need to restore natural flow regimes for the preservation of riparian biodiversity, few studies have examined the effects of river restoration on riparian ecosystems. In this study, we examined the effects of restoration in the Ume River system, northern Sweden, where tributaries were channelized to facilitate timber floating in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Restoration at these sites involved the use of heavy machinery to replace instream boulders and remove floatway structures that had previously lined stream banks and cut off secondary channels. We compared riparian plant communities along channelized stream reaches with those along reaches that had been restored 3-10 years prior to observation. Species richness and evenness were significantly increased at restored sites, as were floodplain inundation frequencies. These findings demonstrate how river restoration and associated changes in fluvial disturbance regimes can enhance riparian biodiversity. Given that riparian ecosystems tend to support a disproportionate share of regional species pools, these findings have potentially broad implications for biodiversity conservation at regional or landscape scales.

Enhancing vegetation diversity in glades, rides and roads in plantation forests	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						biodiversity; sustainable forest management; gap; open space; forest road; forestry	UPLAND CONIFER FORESTS; GROUND FLORA; OPEN SPACES; MANAGEMENT; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; BRITAIN; CONSERVATION; LANDSCAPE; WOODLAND	Permanent open spaces in plantation forests provide an opportunity for enhancing biodiversity in plantations and in the wider landscape. We surveyed vegetation in 60 glades, rides and roads in 12 Irish plantation forests, and collected data on solar radiation, soil and management. Variation in species richness and diversity of vascular plants and bryophytes was determined principally by soil factors and open space management. Light levels were positively associated with vascular plant species richness and negatively associated with richness of bryophytes. In rides, the most important plantation feature in determining solar radiation levels and plant diversity was ride width. increasing edge-to-area ratio corresponded with a decrease in P-diversity within glades. Roadside plots most strongly influenced by road gravel and disturbance supported the highest vascular plant, open-habitat and ruderal species richness and vegetation evenness. For open spaces to contribute significantly to the biodiversity of plantation forests, rides and roads should be a minimum of 15 m in width and glades should be a minimum of 625-900 In 2 in area.

We used newly available spatial and remote sensing datasets, including spacebome optical and radar observations, and new techniques of spatial data analysis to generate subbasin (>= 100 km(2)), stream, and floodplain and wetland habitat classifications. We then generated a preliminary plan for a network of conservation areas to protect the most intact examples of representative habitat types while maximizing longitudinal and lateral connectivity. Proposed additions for freshwater conservation complement existing reserves and build on earlier conservation planning efforts for terrestrial ecosystems. In the resulting integrated plan, at least 20% of the area of each major freshwater habitat type is represented and two continuous corridors exist from the mouth of the Madre de Dios to its headwaters in the Andes. In total, we highlighted 84 currently unprotected subbasins to fulfill our representation and connectivity goals. About two-thirds of these subbasins were considered relatively undisturbed and are identified as Level I (critical management zones) or Level II (indigenous territories), whereas one-third are potentially degraded and thus were designated as Level III (threat mitigation zones). This exercise provides an example of how newly available remote-sensing datasets and analytical tools may be used to advance freshwater conservation planning, particularly in data-poor regions.

Stream insect occupancy-frequency patterns and metapopulation structure	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						aquatic insect; core-satellite; distribution; sampling intensity; spatial scale	CORE-SATELLITE HYPOTHESIS; SPECIES HYPOTHESIS; REGIONAL-DISTRIBUTION; ANIMAL COMMUNITIES; LOCAL ABUNDANCE; DISTURBANCE; DYNAMICS; DIVERSITY; SCALE; DISTRIBUTIONS	An understanding of the distribution patterns of organisms and the underlying factors is a fundamental goal of ecology. One commonly applied approach to visualize these is the analysis of occupancy-frequency patterns. We used data sets describing stream insect distributions from different regions of North America to analyze occupancy-frequency patterns and assess the effects of spatial scale, sampling intensity, and taxonomic resolution on these patterns. Distributions were dominated by satellite taxa (those occurring in <= 10% of sites), whereas the occurrence of core taxa (occurring in >= 90% of sites) determined the overall modality of occupancy-frequency patterns. The proportions of satellite taxa increased with spatial scale and showed positive relationships with sampling intensity (r(2)=0.74-0.96). Furthermore, analyses of data sets from New York (USA) showed that generic-level assessments underestimated the satellite class and occasionally shifted occupancy-frequency distributions from unimodal to bimodal. Our results indicate that, regardless of species- or generic-level taxonomy, stream insect communities are characterized by satellite species and that the proportion of satellite species increases with spatial scale and sampling intensity. Thus, niche-based models of occupancy-frequency patterns better characterize stream insect communities than metapopulation models such as the core-satellite species hypothesis.

Feeding habits of Abrothrix andinus, Phyllotis xanthopygus (Rodentia) and Lepus europaeus (Lagomorpha) in an Andean environment of Chile	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL			Spanish	Article						high altitude Andean environment; diet; hares; native rodents; dietary selection; dietary overlap	MARA DOLICHOTIS-PATAGONUM; AVAILABILITY DATA; SMALL MAMMALS; FOOD-HABITS; DIETS; HARE	The native rodents Abrothrix andinus, Phyllotis xanthopygus and the introduced lagomorph Lepus europaeus coexist in the highlands of north-central Chile, where food availability is scarce. We hypothesized that in these environments, the studied species would behave as generalist herbivores and where the diet of native rodents would overlap that of hares greatly. The aim of this study was to quantify feeding habits, amplitude, diet preferences and overlap of these three species through microhistological analysis of fresh faeces. While all three species behaved as herbivore-folivores, L. europaeus showed the largest niche breath. Abrothrix andinus selected all consumed items, while P. xanthopygus and L. europaeus exhibited a more opportunistic consumption food items. The highest diet overlap was observed between native rodents.

All global biodiversity analyses have identified the mountains of northwestern Yunnan as a conservation priority for plant diversity. The challenge we were presented with was how to transform this sweeping global recognition into regional geographic priorities and measurable conservation action. This challenge is especially acute in Yunnan where there are no readily accessible data on the distribution and status of plant diversity, yet great conservation urgency due to the rapid pace of economic development. We used endangered and endemic species to represent plant diversity as a whole due to time and financial constraints. To identify conservation priorities, we relied on experts' knowledge, supplemented with a rapidly assembled plant diversity data base, rapid field assessments to fill knowledge gaps, and analyses of the spatial patterns of richness and habitat relationships. Ninety-eight endangered species and 703 endemic species occur in the project area. Experts identified nine Plant Diversity Conservation Areas for northwestern Yunnan, including eight specific geographies and one priority habitat. We found that the current nature reserve system is serving an important role in plant diversity protection, even though many of the reserves were not specifically designated for plant diversity considerations. This project provided a means for scientific experts to directly contribute to conservation decision-making by government and Non-Government Organizations, and essential information for the plant conservation in Northwestern Yunnan.

J	Trigas, P; Iatrou, G; Karetsos, G				Trigas, Panayiotis; Iatrou, Gregoris; Karetsos, Giorgos			Species diversity, endemism and conservation of the family Caryophyllaceae in Greece	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						biogeography; Caryophyllaceae; conservation; diversity; endemism; Greece	MEXICO	The family Caryophyllaceae includes world-wide 86 genera and approximately 2100 species. Greece is one of its most important centres of diversity and endemism. A total of 428 Caryophyllaceae taxa are distributed in Greece, 161 of them being endemic to the Greek political territory. The endemic element represents approximately 5% of the global diversity of the family at the species level. The aim of this paper is to discuss the distribution patterns of the Greek endemic Caryophyllaceae, as well as those with a limited distribution range to the neighbouring areas of the Balkans and Anatolia, on the basis of the phytogeographical regions of Greece in order to identify the important regions for their conservation. The majority of the Greek endemic Caryophyllaceae (64.6%) are distributed in only one single phytogeographical region, or even a smaller area indicating the extremely restricted distribution ranges of the endemic plants in Greece. Actually 83 Greek endemic Caryophyllaceae can be grouped on cytotaxonomic criteria. Most of them belong to the category of schizoendemics (91.6%), indicating that the endemism of Caryophyllaceae in Greece has mainly originated in an active way. Cluster analysis has been used to classify the phytogeographical regions according to their floristic similarities. Two iterative complementarity methods were used to evaluate the importance of each phytogeographical region in the conservation of the endemic Caryophyllaceae in Greece. Peloponnisos, Kriti-Karpathos and Sterea Ellas are the most important phytogeographical regions in this respect, followed by North Central and North East. When adding the Balkan-Aegean-Anatolian endemics to the analysis, Peloponnisos, North Central, Kriti-Karpathos, North East and Eastern Aegean result as the most important areas. In every case, an elevated number of sites are required for the conservation of Caryophyllaceae in Greece, reflecting the great dissimilarities in the floristic composition of the various phytogeographical regions. The results provided by the different methods are compared. A catalogue of the Greek endemic Caryophyllaceae is appended.

It was found that the food of S. acanthias and R. clavata in the area studied consisted of mainly fish and crustaceans. The availability of prey was found to be the main criterion in the spiny dogfish feeding strategy. In winter, anchovy were the dominant prey for S. acanthias. This reflects that there is a high availability of these prey in the region. The availability of prey items affected the diet composition, the values of diet breadth, the prey similarity and the dietary overlap of the thornback ray and spiny dogfish. The study has shown that the prey similarity index of these species was 38%. The diet of R. clavata was significantly overlapped by the diet of S. acanthias (1.38). However, S. acanthias was observed to have a more unique diet and was insignificantly overlapped by R. clavata (0.36). The overall results indicate that the spiny dogfish is an indiscriminate predator preying upon those species that are most abundant and available in the area and season, and that R. clavata also feed mainly on anchovy and whiting in the winter but shift to crab and Gobius sp., a demersal species common in the area, together with whiting for the rest of the year.

We evaluate the role of fish abundance, body size and behaviour as determinants of interactions with cleaning mutualists. Data come from eight reef locations in Brazil, the Caribbean, the Mediterranean and Australia. We conducted a meta-analysis of client-cleaner interactions involving 11 cleaner and 221 client species. There was a strong, positive effect of client abundance on cleaning frequency, but only a weak, negative effect of client body size. These effects were modulated by client trophic group and social behaviour. This study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting a central role of species abundance in structuring species interactions.

Invading Mnemiopsis leidyi as a potential threat to Baltic fish	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						invasive species; cod recruitment; Baltic food web	CTENOPHORE MNEMIOPSIS; BLACK-SEA; BASIN	The occurrence of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi as a new invasive species in the Baltic Sea and the potential consequences for fish stock recruitment was investigated in spring 2007. The study focused on the Bornholm Basin, which serves as the major spawning ground for cod and sprat, the commercially most important fish stocks in the Baltic. The distribution pattern of M. leidyi revealed a substantial overlap with cod eggs. The observed predation of M. leidyi on eggs has the potential to alter the recruitment success of cod, which is the top predator in the system and, thus, to change the Baltic food-web structure.

The shapes of phylogenetic trees of clades, faunas, and local assemblages: Exploring spatial pattern in differential diversification	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						diversity skewness; tree balance; community structure; primates; phylogeny	BALANCE; COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY; IMBALANCE; MODELS; HYPOTHESES; STATISTICS; SPECIATION; EVOLUTION; RICHNESS	Life on Earth is characterized by strong diversity skewness: related lineages typically show pronounced variation in diversification success, and clades contain hyperdiverse and depauperate subclades. Previous studies have documented diversity skewness only for entire ( global) clades. We demonstrate methods for measurement and significance testing of diversity skewness of local assemblages and regional biotas; we illustrate this with an analysis of geographic structure in diversity skewness of primate assemblages. For primates, continental faunas differ in diversity skewness from expectations based on the global phylogeny: South American faunas have significantly low skewness and African faunas have significantly high skewness. However, no local assemblage has diversity skewness different from that expected based on sampling the continental fauna. We also document a latitudinal gradient in diversity skewness for the African assemblages and test for ( but do not find) associations of skewness with longitude, local species richness, and net primary productivity. Our data suggest that continental-scale biogeographic events rather than local-scale processes have shaped diversity skewness in modern primate faunas.

Juvenile hormone III influences task-specific cuticular hydrocarbon profile changes in the ant Myrmicaria eumenoides	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						cuticular hydrocarbons; division of labor; juvenile hormone; social insects; task	HONEY-BEE COLONIES; DIVISION-OF-LABOR; SOLID-PHASE MICROEXTRACTION; BEHAVIORAL-DEVELOPMENT; HARVESTER ANTS; PACHYCONDYLA-VILLOSA; NESTMATE RECOGNITION; ENDOCRINE REGULATION; INSECT HYDROCARBONS; BLATTELLA-GERMANICA	We investigated the influence of juvenile hormones (JH) on the composition of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) and the division of labor in colonies of the African ant Myrmicaria eumenoides. CHCs have long been implicated in nestmate recognition in social insect colonies. In M. eumenoides, the CHC profiles also vary with the task performed from brood-tender-type to forager type. The endocrine factors regulating the task allocation as well as the intracolonial recognition cues are not well understood, but JHs are prime candidates. Only JH III was identified in the hemolymph of M. eumenoides workers. Foragers had significantly higher JH III titers than brood tenders. The application of exogenous JH III and a JH analogue (methoprene) to M. eumenoides workers did not result in an observable acceleration of task change in our study. However, longevity of the focus workers, and thus the observational period, was reduced by the applications. Changes from a brood-tender-type to a forager-type CHC profile were accelerated by the application of JH III and methoprene, resulting in brood-tending workers that displayed forager-type CHC profiles. We present the first data supporting that recognition cues of an eusocial Hymenopteran are influenced by JH III, which could thus play a major role in the regulation of the dynamic nature of social insect colonies. JH III is connected to at least two key processes: the acceleration of CHC changes and the more long-term modulation of task shifting. Moreover, this indicates that changes in CHC recognition cues do not trigger task allocation in social insect colonies.

From 241 gullet samples (esophagus and proventriculus content) collected over three winters (1999-2002) near Nuuk, we identified 39 species consumed by the eiders. In contrast to studies elsewhere, fresh mass of the diet was dominated by soft-bottom species: the bivalve Mya eideri (32.8%) and the polychaete Pectinaria spp. (24.2%). The hard-bottom blue mussel (Mytilus edulis), usually the dominant prey of common eiders, was only the fourth most important diet species (7.5%). Overall, bivalves accounted for 56% of the diet. Twenty-seven prey species were minor foods with aggregate fresh mass of only 5.5%. Diets of males and females were similar, whereas juveniles consumed greater mass of crustaceans and less of bivalves. Diet diversity was higher in mid-winter than late winter, and higher in coastal habitats than in fjords. Within one important wintering area the results indicate that optimal size of blue mussels may be depleted over winter.

J	Olejniczak, I				Olejniczak, Izabella			Soil mesofauna (Acarina and Collembola) along transects crossed shelterbelts of different age and adjacent fields	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						collembola; Acarina; shelterbelts of different age; species diversity	BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; HUMUS; FAUNA	The communities of soil mesofauna were studied in the year 2004 along three transects crossed shelterbelts of different age (6, 11 and 170 years old) and adjacent wheat fields at a distance of 0.5, 15 and 50 m. Studies were carried out in the Gen. D. Chlapowski Landscape Park near Turew, Western Poland (16 degrees 45'E, 52 degrees 01'W). The age of shelterbelts vegetation affected soil mesofauna. of adjacent fields in a diverse way. The mean density of mites amounts 7.4 x 10(3) ind. m(-2) and 2.6 x 10(3) ind. m(-2) respectively for the shelterbelts and fields. Densities of Acarina communities were affected not only by the presence of a shelterbelt (P = 0.000) but also its age (P = 0.02) and the distance from it (P = 0.000), and these effects were similar in spring and autumn (P = 0.08). The mean density of springtail noted in shelterbelts of different age was 2.0 x 10(3) ind. m(-2) and in the field sites 2.2 x 10(3) ind. m(-2). Although the effect of the shelterbelts' age on the density of Collembola was not found (P = 0.3), the densities were different in shelterbelts and in adjacent fields (P = 0.006) but statistical significance was found only between spring and autumn (P = 0.000). The distance from the shelterbelt influenced (though less intensely) the density of Collembola on adjacent field (P = 0.01). Eighteen species of Collembola were found in studied shelterbelts and fields. Isotoma notabilis Schaff. usually dominated in shelterbelts. Its contribution to abundance of communities varied depending on the age of shelterbelts (in 6 years old shelterbelt it constituted as many as 71% of the whole community). In 11 years old shelterbelt Schoetella ununguiculata (Tullb.), was more common than Isotoma notabilis Schaff. and in the 170 years old shelterbelt the dominant species was Onychiurus armatus (Tullb.). Friesea mirabilis (Tullb.), Proisotoma minuta (Tallb.), Isotoma notabilis or Onychiurus armatus dominated in adjacent fields though their contribution was depended on shelterbelt's age and on the distance from it.

Two imported willow tree species (S. fragilis and S. alba) are extensively cultivated in the Lahaul valley through traditional shoot-cuttings plantation method in indigenous agroforestry and forestry systems for fuel wood, fodder and minor timber; both the willows are well established in the cold desert environment. The density of S. fragilis was highest at Jahlma (365 individuals ha(-1)) followed by Hinsa (244 individuals ha(-1)) under agroforestry systems in south facing hill slopes; I these are middle altitude sites in the Lahaul valley. Highest density of willow was at Hinsa (453' individuals ha(-1)) followed by Jahlma (305 individuals ha(-1)) on north facing hill slopes. S. fragilis was not found in natural condition in forest of the Lahaul valley, relatively lesser density of 20 individuals ha-1 at south facing hill slopes of Jahlma and 6 individuals ha-1 at Hinsa in north facing hill slopes, basically planted by the villagers. The average biomass production were 37.3 t ha(-1) and 20.3 t-ha(-1) under idle circumference categories of 60-96 and 30-60 cm girth classes, respectively. Willow provides 18.5% to 69.5% of total fuel,wood requirement of the farmers in the Lahaul valley. The average number of willow trees per household ranged from 5.8 to 127.5 individuals at village level, which was not sufficient to fulfill the present wood based requirement of farmers for survival in cold desert environment. To sustain unique cold desert ecosystem and environment, plantation of wild and cultivated willow, varieties of other established indigenous and exotic plant species (trees, shrubs, bushes, grasses, herbs, climbers), that survive under -40 degrees C to -20 degrees C temperature in general and fulfill primary requirement of farmers along with potential of alleviate xeric cold desert environment is needed.

Location European continent. Methods After gathering native fish faunistic lists of 406 hydrographical networks, we defined large biogeographical regions with homogenous fish fauna, based on a hierarchical cluster analysis. Then we analysed and compared the patterns in species richness and endemism among these regions, as well as species-area relationships. Results Among the 233 native species present in the data set, the Cyprinidae family was strongly dominant (> 50% of the total number of species). Seven biogeographical regions were defined: Western Peri-Mediterranea, Central Peri-Mediterranea, Eastern Peri-Mediterranea, Ponto-Caspian Europe, Northern Europe, Central Europe and Western Europe. The highest regional species richness was observed for Central Peri-Mediterranea and Ponto-Caspian Europe. The highest endemic richness was found in Central Peri-Mediterranea. Species-area relationships were characterized by high slope values for Peri-Mediterranean Europe and low values for Central and Western Europe. Main Conclusion The results were in agreement with the 'Lago Mare' hypothesis explaining the specificity of Peri-Mediterranean fish fauna, as well as with the history of recolonization of Central and Western Europe from Ponto-Caspian Europe following the LGM. The results also agreed with the mechanisms of speciation and extinction influencing fish diversity in hydrographical networks. We advise the use of the seven biogeographical regions for further studies, and suggest considering Peri-Mediterranean Europe and Ponto-Caspian Europe as 'biodiversity hotspots' for European riverine fish.

It typically parasitizes wild plants but has recently been described as an agricultural problem in legume crops in Tunisia. The pattern of genetic variation within and among O.. foetida populations growing on chickpea and faba bean was analyzed by RAPD markers. The UPGMA cluster analysis based on Dice distance matrix showed a clear differentiation among O. foetida samples collected on chickpea and those on faba bean, suggesting a host-differentiation process. Although an AMOVA analysis revealed substantial internal variation among individuals within O. foetida populations (69.8%), there was a significant divergence between parasites on the two hosts considered (30.2%). Moreover, germination of O. foetida seeds collected on chickpea and faba bean in the presence of both host roots was studied. Germination percentages of O. foetida seeds varied depending on the host used both for collecting the seeds and evaluating the trait. According to these results, possible explanations for the origin of this new weedy parasite and the host differentiation process are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Amazonia; beta diversity; indicator species; Melastomataceae; pteridophytes; soil; trees; tropical rain forest; vegetation inventory	BETA-DIVERSITY; COLOMBIAN AMAZONIA; SATELLITE IMAGERY; PLANT; LANDSCAPE; COMMUNITIES; VEGETATION; DOMINANCE; CLASSIFICATION; SPECIALIZATION	Studies in western Amazonian forests have found that similarities in soil cation concentration and texture explain floristic similarities between sites. when these are measured using trees, pteridophytes or Melastomataceae. However, it is not known to what extent the three plant groups react to the same soil characteristics, because free studies have almost always been conducted in different areas than studies oil the understorey plant groups. We made inventories in 23 sites representing non-inundated rain forests oil clayey to loamy soil in three regions of western Amazonia. Significant Mantel correlations between the floristic patterns of trees and pteridophytes were found ill 111 three regions when floristic differences were Measured with species presence-absence data. When species abundance data Were used, and when the floristic patterns of trees and Melastoinataceae were compared, significant correlations were found in one or two regions. Mantel correlations between plant groups were highest in the two regions where the observed variation in soil characteristics was largest. In all regions, the same soil variables emerged with significant Mantel correlations with trees, pteridophytes and Melastomataceae. Soil calcium and magnesium were most frequently retained in the models Of Multiple regression oil distance matrices. Oil average, soil differences explained 50% of the variation in floristic differences (range = 14-84%) and geographical distances explained 16% (range = 0-64%). Our results demonstrate that beta diversities of the three plant groups are highly correlated, and that Much of this congruence is explained by similar reactions to soil variation. These results support the idea that pteridophytes. and to a lesser degree Melastomataceae. call be used as indicators of general floristic and edaphic patterns in Amazonian rain forests. Since understorey plants are Much quicker to inventory than trees. this would make it possible to recognize and map floristic patterns over huge areas of lowland Amazonia within a reasonable time.

Secondary forest succession differs through naturalised gorse and native kanuka near Wellington and Nelson	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						forest restoration; invasive plants; successional pathways; weed impacts	NEW-ZEALAND; BANKS PENINSULA; KUNZEA-ERICOIDES; PORT-HILLS; VEGETATION; COMMUNITIES; ACCUMULATION; REGENERATION; CANTERBURY; MECHANISMS	The dominant native woody species forming early-successional vegetation on formerly forested sites in lowland New Zealand were kanuka (Kunzea ericoides) and manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) (Myrtaceae). These have been replaced extensively by gorse (Ulex europaeus, Fabaccae), a naturalised species in New Zealand. Because gorse typically gives way to native broadleaved (angiosperm) forest in about 30 years, it is often considered desirable for facilitating native forest restoration. We tested three hypotheses, derived from the New Zealand literature, on gorse and kanuka: (1) kanuka stands have a different species composition and greater species richness than gorse stands at comparable successional stages; (2) differences between gorse and kanuka stands do not lessen over time; and (3) several native plant taxa are absent from or less common in gorse than in kanuka stands. We sampled 48 scrub or low-forest sites in two regions, Wellington and Nelson. Sites were classified into one of four predefined categories - young gorse, young kanuka, old gorse, old kanuka - based on canopy height of the succession and the dominant early-successional woody species. Few characteristics of the sites and surrounding landscapes differed significantly among site categories, and none consistently across regions. The vegetation composition of gorse and kanuka and their immediate successors differed in both regions, mainly in native woody species. Species richness was often lower in gorse and there were fewer small-leaved shrubs and orchids in gorse. Persistent differences at the older sites suggest the successional trajectories will not converge in the immediate future; gorse leads to different forest from that developed through kanuka. Gorse-dominated succession is therefore not a direct substitute for native successions. We suggest areas of early native succession should be preserved, and initiated in landscapes where successions are dominated by gorse or other naturalised shrubs.

We provide evidence that control of introduced possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) may increase ship rat(Rattus rattus) abundance in some New Zealand native forests. Ship rat abundance in a podocarp-hardwood forest was assessed using simple interference indices over 14 years (1990-2004) that included two aerial possum-poisoning operations (1994, 2000). Ship rat demography and rat and possum diet were measured from June 2001 to June 2003 when the rat population was increasing after the 2000 poisoning. Mean ship rat abundance indices increased nearly fivefold after possum control and remained high for up to 6 years after the 1994 poisoning. Rat fecundity was high (50-100% of adult females breeding), even during winter, and young animals dominated the population (73% in age classes 1-3) in 2001-2002 when rat numbers were increasing. During 2002-2003, rat abundance stabilised, without marked winter or spring reductions, the population aged significantly (only 32% in age classes 1-3), and fecundity declined to low levels (4-27% of adult females breeding). Although seeds and fruit dominated the diet of rats driving population recovery after control (74.0% of total diet by dry weight), rat fecundity was instead closely correlated with the proportional consumption of invertebrates (r = 0.91). Juvenile survival was correlated with proportional seed consumption (r = 0.75), while adult survival was correlated with combined seed and invertebrate consumption (r = 0.83). Adult rats ate more seeds and fewer invertebrates than juvenile rats. Seeds and fruit also dominated possum diet (52.2% of total diet). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that increased rat abundance following possum control is a consequence of greater availability of, or reduced competition for, seeds and fruit.

We investigated species composition and abundance of seagrasses as well as the physical environmental factors for six transects around Ishigaki Island, southwest Japan. Eight species occurred in the quadrat census. The occurrence frequencies ranged from 66.8% (Thalassia hemprichii) to 4.5% (Enhalus acoroides). Both canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and cluster analysis elucidated that depth was mainly responsible for the distributions of species and assemblage type. Monte Carlo permutation for partial CCA revealed that 37.5% of the variance was explained by depth, 10.3% by sediment thickness and 4.6% by silt-clay content in the sediment. Twenty-six sites were categorized into four assemblage types by a cluster analysis using the leaf area index (LAI; the ratio of total leaf area to bottom area) as a measure of species abundance. Type I was dominated by T. hemprichii and Cymodocea rotundata, Type II by C. serrulata, Type III by E. acoroides, and Type IV by Halodule pinifolia and Halophila ovalis. Type I occurred mostly in the intertidal zone (91.3 +/- 30.5 cm below MSL, mean sea level), Type II in the subtidal zone (179.1 +/- 75.0 cm below MSL) and Type IV in both shallow sites (between 47.8 and 75.6 cm below MSL) and in those with low silt-clay contents (between 2.0 and 3.8%).

Few studies, however, examined large-scale spatial variability in the distribution and abundance of marine organisms, with rare attempts to directly compare spatial variation at local (centimetres-metres) vs. regional (1000's of kilometres) scale. Here, we used a hierarchical design to describe the spatial distribution of the hydroids epiphitic of the brown alga Cystoseira amentacea, a habitat-forming species that provides a continuous, extensive settling substrate at regional scale along the rocky coasts in the Mediterranean Sea. This continuity provides the potential to deal with scale-related variability, increasing area of investigation without adding differences deriving from habitat heterogeneity or changes in topographic complexity. Hydroids were selected for their abundance and for their life cycle features (rapid growth, small body size, early sexual or asexual reproduction and short life span), allowing rapid responses to changes in environmental conditions. The aim of this study was to analyse whether the structure of hydroid assemblages living on C. amentacea had a consistent pattern of variation among three portions of the algal thallus (i.e., basal, middle, and distal) across a spectrum of scales and whether having or not a pelagic stage could exert a significant influence on the distribution patterns of the species. A total of 32 species were identified. Multivariate analyses showed that hydroid colonization of Cystoseira occurs differently along each thallus, with patterns of variation in the structure of assemblages differing at an even smaller spatial scale than that of single plants. However, such differences varied from patch to patch. Among the 14 species identified as "important" to define the hydroid assemblage inhabiting Cystoseira, only one (Clytia hemisphaerica) has free medusae, the other species reproducing by fixed gonophores or by short-lived medusoids. Univariate analysis showed significant differences among portions of thalli in terms of spatial variability at the various scales investigated, thus suggesting that patterns of multivariate variation along the three portions of thalli might vary across scale. Overall, our results suggest that patterns of distribution of hydroids along C. amentacea thalli significantly vary across spatial scales but that the observed differences can be hardly interpreted on the basis of life-cycle patterns.

Role of rarity and taxonomic resolution in a regional and spatial analysis of stream macroinvertebrates	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						aquatic insects; sampling design; community structure; richness; relative abundance; impairment; multivariate statistics	SAVANNAH-RIVER-PLANT; BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATES; MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS; AQUATIC INSECTS; SOUTH-CAROLINA; RUNS-CREEK; BIOASSESSMENT; RARE; COMMUNITIES; ASSEMBLAGES	Quantitative sampling of benthic macroinvertebrate communities from 60 sites in New York City's drinking-water-supply watersheds was undertaken in 2000, 2001, and 2002 as part of a large-scale enhanced water-quality monitoring project (the Project). Sampling yielded 543 macroinvertebrate taxonomic units, most of which (including Chironomidae) were identified to the genus/species level. Our goals were to investigate the effect of level of taxonomic resolution on statistical macroinvertebrate-enviromnent relationships, the effect of including rare taxa on among-site similarity and macroinvertebrate-environment relationships, and the correlations between the common and rare components of the total community at each site. Mean site richness ranged from 90.8 to 101.2 taxa for sites west of Hudson River (WOH) and 62.2 to 78.5 taxa for sites east of Hudson River (EOH). Species-level identifications provided the greatest separation of sites in multivariate space, but genus- and family-level identifications discriminated between most- and least-impacted sites, particularly in the EOH region where anthropogenic impact was greatest. Of the 543 taxa, 175 (32%) were found at < 3 sites, and nearly 1/2 of the taxa within a given site were occasional (found once in 3 y). Numerically rare taxa (defined as either < 1% or < 0.3% relative abundance within each site) accounted for 42 to 75% (WOH) and 37 to 73% (EOH) of mean site richness. Ordinations of data sets including or excluding rare taxa revealed similar impact gradients, and the % of spatial variance explained by environmental factors was similar with and without rare taxa. included. Common taxa contributed noise to site-similarity patterns in the WOH region, and rare taxa provided information that was redundant with information provided by common taxa in the EOH region.

This work aimed to generate basic information for the conservation of three Encholirium species that are endemic to the rocky mountains of Cadeia do Espinhaco, employing population genetic analyses. E. pedicellatum and E. biflorum have only one very small population each, both occurring in unprotected, private land sites, being critically endangered. E. subsecundum is more widespread, and some of its populations dwell in protected areas. Five Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers generated approximately 60 polymorphic bands for each species. This technique demonstrated the presence of a single RAPD profile for every individual sampled (except for one clone found in E. biflorum). High levels of genetic variability were not expected, due to the clonal habit of the plants and small size of the populations. Populations of E. biflorum and E. pedicellatum presented, respectively, 16.06% (Phi(st) = 0.16, p < 0.001) and 8.44% (Phi(st) = 0.08, p < 0.001) of the total genetic diversity attributable to genetic differences among groups within the populations. In E. subsecundum, 14.52% (Phi(st) = 0.15, p < 0.001) of the total genetic diversity was found among populations. Estimates of the Shannon's Diversity Index provided similar results. These results are valuable for the development of conservation strategies.

J	Holm, TE; Clausen, P				Holm, Thomas Eske; Clausen, Preben			Effects of water level management on autumn staging waterbird and macrophyte diversity in three Danish coastal lagoons	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Chara; Potamogeton; Ruppia; salinity; shorebird; species diversity; submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV); topography; water depth; water quality; waterfowl	RUPPIA-DOMINATED COMMUNITIES; EXPERIMENTAL REFUGES; MIGRATORY WATERFOWL; WESTERN-EUROPE; BEWICKS SWANS; HABITAT USE; WETLANDS; AVAILABILITY; SHOREBIRDS; DENMARK	Many Danish wetlands frequently experience algae blooms and oxygen deficiencies because of eutrophication caused by enhanced nitrogen and phosphorous levels. As a consequence, wetland managers have focused on improving water quality, but often without considering the suitability of wetlands for waterbirds. In this study, managers improved water quality in two Danish lagoons by opening a floodgate to the sea. We studied the responses of autumn staging waterbirds and submerged vegetation, to resultant higher water replacement rates and water levels. A third lagoon with no change in management was studied for comparisons. Lagoons with rise in water levels experienced declines in bird species diversity, a decline in benthivore species abundances and an increase in herbivore species abundances. Macrophyte biomass increased but seagrass diversity was low due to high salinity. The lagoon with no changes in management control had high and stable waterbird diversity and bird-days spent was increasing during the study period. Explanations for this were diverse typography and low water levels. Furthermore, the macrophyte community was more diverse due to low salinity. In order to improve both water quality and to increase waterbird diversity in the managed lagoons, we suggest water levels should be managed actively during peak migration in autumn. This could secure more shallow-water areas to waders and create better congruence between appropriate water levels and timing of peak bird migration in autumn. The rest of the year the floodgate should be left open in order to secure a high water quality.

J	Lovett, JC; Marshall, AR; Carr, J				Lovett, Jon C.; Marshall, Andrew R.; Carr, Jeff			Changes in tropical forest vegetation along an altitudinal gradient in the Udzungwa Mountains National Park, Tanzania	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						diversity; Eastern Arc; elevation; Tanzania; tropical forest; Udzungwa Mountains National Park	GLOBALLY CONSISTENT RELATIONSHIP; SPECIES-RICHNESS; CONSERVATION PRIORITIES; DIVERSITY GRADIENTS; TAXON RICHNESS; TREE DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; ELEVATION; SCALE; BIODIVERSITY	This study describes changes in woody vegetation in the Mwanihana forest, Udzungwa Mountains National Park, Tanzania, over an altitude range of 470-1700 m. Two methods, fixed- and variable-area plots, are compared to elucidate altitudinal variation in tropical forest structure, diversity and community composition. Six 25 m x 100 m fixed area plots recorded a total of 2143 woody stems of >= 3 cm d.b.h. from 204 species. The 78 variable-area plots recorded the nearest twenty trees of >= 20 cm d.b.h. to an objectively chosen point, giving a total of 1560 stems in 9.1 ha from 156 species. A linear trend of increasing stem density with altitude was seen for variable-area plots. Species diversity is highest at high elevations. There was no clear zonation of elevational vegetation types. Restricted range taxa occur at all altitudes sampled. The study also revealed some methodological considerations. Bias in sample size and plot area can be tested by employing two sampling methods. Of the two methods used, fixed area plots are preferred as variable area plots are impractical in tangled understorey. Plot size must be controlled for in order to make reliable observations of diversity. Sampling along a continuous or near-continuous altitudinal gradient with sufficient replication is also important.

We tested both models by comparing the performance of two understorey species with contrasted stress-tolerance abilities Galium odoratum and Deschampsia flexuosa. Individuals of both species were transplanted in the four combinations of two treatments (gap and removal of an herbaceous competitor, Molinia caerulea). Our experiment demonstrated that direct facilitation of adult trees may explain the restricted occurrence of the shade-demanding Galium within closed forest communities. In contrast, the shade-tolerant Deschampsia was subjected to additional competition within the forest, likely because adult trees had a higher negative effect on light availability and a similar negative effect on nitrogen availability within the forest than did Molinia in the gaps.

J	Paracuellos, M				Paracuellos, Mariano			How can habitat selection affect the use of a wetland complex by waterbirds?	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						conservation; habitat patchiness; habitat selection; Spain; threatened species; waterbird distribution; wetland	SPECIES RICHNESS; FRAGMENTATION; BIRDS; CONSERVATION; POPULATIONS; COMMUNITY; ABUNDANCE; ALMERIA; DUCKS; SPAIN	The factors regulating the distribution of dabbling and diving waterbirds were studied, taking into account habitat selection by the species in a wetland complex of 26 ponds in south-eastern Spain. Such information can be used to management and conservation of wetland threatened bird species. Direct counts and feeding-microhabitat surveys of waterbirds were conducted. The feeding-niche width and the feeding-microhabitat use, as a function of the horizontal spatial gradient in the ponds, were related to the mean size of ponds used for each species. While the more generalist birds, which usually feed close to the shore, probably had available resources in small ponds, specialists that also frequently selected central zones of the pond had proportionally more limited feeding space and, therefore, less resource availability in small ponds. The differences in habitat selection of the different species appeared to encourage their hierarchical disappearance from the wetland complex at the same rate as the ponds diminished in size ('nested' pattern). The results support the conservation, restoration or creation of, at least, ponds of greater size in order to preserve extensive open-water zones in the wetlands and maintain the greatest number of specialist, threatened, and area-dependent species, such as the globally endangered White-headed Duck (Oxyura leucocephala).

Macroinvertebrate assemblage recovery following a catastrophic flood and debris flows in an Appalachian mountain stream	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						catastrophic disturbance; flood; debris flow; macroinvertebrates; taxon richness; density; trophic structure; Appalachian streams	EXPERIMENTAL DISTURBANCE; INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITY; HEADWATER STREAMS; TERM RECOVERY; DESERT STREAM; INSECTS; RECOLONIZATION; EPHEMEROPTERA; STABILITY; RIVER	In June 1995, heavy rains caused severe flooding and massive debris flows on the Staunton River, a 3(rd)-order stream in the Blue Ridge Mountains (Virginia, USA). Scouring caused the loss of the riparian zone and repositioned the stream channel of the lower 2.1 km of the stream. Between 1998 and 2001, we conducted seasonal macroinvertebrate surveys at sites on the Staunton River and on White Oak Canyon Run, a reference stream of similar size and geology that was relatively unaffected by the flood. Our study was designed to determine the extent to which flood-induced changes to the stream channel and riparian habitats caused long-term changes to macroinvertebrate community structure and composition. Sites within the impacted zone of the Staunton River supported diverse stable benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages 3 y after the flood despite dramatic and persistent changes in environmental factors known to be important controls on stream ecosystem function. However, significant differences in total macroinvertebrate density and trophic structure could be attributed to the flood. In autumn, densities of most feeding guilds, including shredders, were higher at impacted-zone sites than at all other sites, suggesting higher overall productivity in the impacted zone. Higher shredder density in the impacted zone was surprising in light of expected decreases in leaf-litter inputs because of removal of riparian forests. In contrast, in spring, we observed density differences in only one feeding guild, scrapers, which showed higher densities at impacted-zone sites than at all other sites. This result conformed to a priori expectations that reduced shading in the impacted zone would lead to increased light and higher instream primary production. We attribute the seasonal differences in trophic structure to the effects of increased temperatures on food quality and to the relationship between the timing of our sampling and the emergence patterns of important taxa.

We designed an experiment to examine interactions related to density dependence of North American elk (Cervus elaphus) and resulting plant responses to herbivory in the Blue Mountains of Oregon, USA, from 1999 to 2001. We experimentally created high (20.1 elk/km(2)) and low (4.1 elk/km(2)) population densities of elk and built exclosures to examine effects of herbivory on productivity and species composition of plants. We hypothesized that if herbivore optimization occurred with increasing density of elk, there should be a concordant increase in plant production, followed by a decline in productivity as grazing intensity continued to increase (i.e., herbivore optimization). Net aboveground primary productivity (NAPP) increased from no herbivory to herbivory by elk at moderate density and then declined as herbivory by elk continued to increase in areas with high NAPP (mesic and logged forests) but not in areas with low NAPP (xeric forests and grasslands). Herbivore optimization occurred across all functional groups of plants, including graminoids, forbs, and shrubs for high-NAPP areas. Herbivore optimization may be difficult to detect in woody plants compared with graminoids because of their differing structure and growth forms. Although herbivore optimization previously has been reported in grasslands, our study documents this phenomenon in woody plant communities. We hypothesize that such subtle changes in NAPP from herbivory might be more common than previously thought; carefully designed experiments are required to detect those responses to herbivory by large herbivores. Apparent offtake of plants followed a similar pattern to NAPP and was greatest at intermediate levels of herbivory by elk, and then declined as NAPP approached zero. Quality of plants, as indexed by percent nitrogen (N), also exhibited a parabolic function with increasing density of elk. Nonetheless, we observed no changes in species composition or diversity of plants with our density manipulations of elk, probably because of the extensive history of grazing by native and domestic herbivores in the Blue Mountains, the resilience of the remaining plants to herbivory, and the short 3-year duration of our study. Likewise, we observed no increases in rates of nutrient cycling with changes in densities of elk., perhaps because areas where large amounts of elk urine and feces were concentrated (e.g., grazing lawns) did not occur in this ecosystem. Herbivore optimization could have ramifications for population dynamics of ungulates. We argue that other processes, such as migration, predation, or harvest, might be necessary to maintain areas of increased NAPP because of strong density-dependent feedbacks and negative effects of ungulates on their food supply would not allow equilibrium between herbivores and their food supply at the low densities where we documented herbivore optimization. We also hypothesize that increased NAPP at low to moderate population densities of herbivores could lead to rapid population growth of these herbivores and help reduce density-dependent feedbacks and promote overshoots of carrying capacity. Our data do not support stocking large densities of ungulates on western rangelands to obtain peak production of NAPP. We recommend maintaining low to moderate densities of large herbivores in ecosystems if goals are to maximize NAPP and forage quality or to maximize body condition and reproduction of ungulates.

Using landscape suitability models to reconcile conservation planning for two key forest predators	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						conservation planning; landscape suitability; fisher; Martes pennanti; spotted owl; Strix occidentalis; habitat suitability; modeling	NORTHERN SPOTTED OWLS; NORTHWESTERN CALIFORNIA; HABITAT MODELS; MARTES-PENNANTI; RESERVE DESIGN; SELECTION; POPULATIONS; FISHERS; USA; PROBABILITIES	Protection of area-limited species is an important component of plans to conserve biodiversity, but the habitat needs of such species can be different and important habitats may not align with existing reserves. We used empirically derived landscape suitability models for the spotted owl and the fisher to evaluate the overlap in habitat suitability for these two old forest-associated predators in an area of northern California affected by the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP), a bioregional conservation plan. The area includes designated Wilderness areas and new reserves (Late-Successional Reserves, LSRs) established under the NWFP. We used the site selection algorithm MARXAN to identify priority habitat areas for each species, and for both combined, and to compare these areas with reserves. Sites were selected under two constraints, to achieve a threshold proportion of total habitat value and to select new areas equal to the total current area in existing reserves. The rank correlation between predicted value for the two species was low (0.11), because areas of highest predicted habitat value were more widely distributed for the owl. This difference also meant that the sites selected to optimize habitat value were more aggregated for fishers than owls, resulting in greater overlap of owl habitat and current reserves. To capture 25%, 50% and 75% of total habitat value for the owl required 14.0%, 29.2%, and 47.3% of the planning units, respectively; capturing the same for the fisher required only 5.3%, 13.5%, and 27.2%. A combined owl-fisher scenario resulted in areas that overlapped only similar to 50% of existing reserves. The current location of LSRs may not be the best solution to maintaining well-connected habitats for these area-limited species in northwestern California. Whether LSRs are a better solution to protecting the diversity of other lesser-known taxa (i.e., salamanders and mollusks) is the subject of related work. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

They harm their hosts by causing mutations or genomic rearrangements, and most organisms have evolved various mechanisms to suppress their activity. The evolutionary dynamics of transposons in insects, fish, birds and mammals are dramatically different. Mammalian genomes contain few, very abundant but relatively inactive transposon strains, while Drosophila and fish species harbour diverse strains, which typically have low abundance but are much more virulent. We hypothesise that the variation in the diversity and activity of transposable elements between various animal genomes is caused by the differences in the host defence mechanisms against transposon activity. In recent years RNAi, a mechanism capable of gene, virus and transposon silencing has been discovered. We model RNAi as a density dependant mechanism of defence, which can cause competition among transposons depending on its specificity, and test its predictions using the complete Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Fugu rubripes, chicken, mouse, rat and human genome sequences.

People, species richness and human population growth	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Birds; conservation conflicts; environmental energy; frogs; humans; population growth; protected areas; South Africa; species richness	SOUTH-AFRICA; UNITED-STATES; CONSERVATION IMPLICATIONS; ENERGY RELATIONSHIP; BIODIVERSITY; BIRDS; EXTINCTION; DEFORESTATION; PRODUCTIVITY; RESERVE	Aim To investigate how the magnitude of conservation conflicts arising from positive relationships between human population size and species richness is altered during a period of marked human population growth (2% year(-1)). Location South Africa. Methods Anuran and avian species richness were calculated from atlas distribution maps, and human population was measured in 1996 and 2001, all at a quarter-degree resolution. We investigated the relationships between human population size in, and its change during, these two periods and environmental energy availability. We then investigated the nature of relationships between species richness and human population size in both time periods, and its change during them; these analyses were conducted both with and without taking environmental energy availability into account. Finally, we investigated the nature of the relationships between human population size, and its change, and the proportion of protected land. Analyses were conducted both without and with taking spatial autocorrelation into account; the latter was achieved using mixed models that fitted a spatial covariance structure to the data. Results Change in human population size between 1996 and 2001 exhibited marked spatial variation, with both large increases and decreases, but was poorly correlated with environmental energy availability. The nature of the relationship between human population size and environmental energy availability did not, however, exhibit statistically significant differences regardless of whether the former was measured in 1996 or 2001. Similarly, relationships between species richness and human population size did not exhibit significant differences between the two periods. The strengths of the species human relationships were markedly reduced when energy availability was taken into account. Change in human population size was poorly correlated with species richness. The proportion of protected land was negatively, albeit rather weakly, correlated with human population size in 1996 and 2001, and with its change between these two periods. Main conclusions Positive species-human relationships arise largely, but not entirely, because both species richness and human population size exhibit similar responses to environmental energy availability. During a period of rapid human population growth, and marked changes in the spatial variation in human population size, positive correlations remained between human population size and both anuran and avian species richness. The slope of these correlations did not, however, alter, and the most species-rich areas are not those with the largest increases in human population. Despite marked population growth, the magnitude of conservation conflicts arising from positive species-human relationships thus appears to have remained largely unchanged.

We investigated the relationship between tree size and flowering (and subsequent dying) across 18 populations from the flowering event of 2003 in order to understand the role of possible size thresholds for flowering in the life history and regeneration ecology of this monocarpic species. There was a strong positive correlation between trunk diameter and the incidence of flowering when population data were combined. However, the relationship between size and flowering was complex in that flowering occurred across a wide range of tree sizes, with almost complete overlap in size between flowering (5-79 cm dbh) and non-flowering trees (5-64 cm dbh), and with large trees in both the flowering and nonflowering state in the same population. In about half the populations studied there was no significant difference in mean trunk diameter of flowering and non-flowering trees. Nonetheless, we suggest that tree size may play a fundamental role in the life history and regeneration ecology of this species. The seedlings appear to be relatively shade-intolerant and dependent on large canopy gaps for recruitment. A significant effect of mass flowering and subsequent death of multiple large trees is the potential to form large canopy gaps and enhance seedling survival, as the gap is temporally linked with seed germination. However, it is unclear why there is such a large size range of flowering trees, i.e. whether this is just a consequence of the proximate cue, or whether the optimal size for flowering does indeed vary among individuals.

Microbial community structure in three deep-sea carbonate crusts	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY			English	Article							ANAEROBIC METHANE OXIDATION; SULFATE-REDUCING BACTERIA; ANOXIC MARINE-SEDIMENTS; METHANOGENIC ARCHAEA; BLACK-SEA; AUTHIGENIC CARBONATES; COLD SEEPS; CONSORTIUM; DIVERSITY; MICROORGANISMS	Carbonate crusts in marine environments can act as sinks for carbon dioxide. Therefore, understanding carbonate crust formation could be important for understanding global warming. In the present study, the microbial communities of three carbonate crust samples from deep-sea mud volcanoes in the eastern Mediterranean were characterized by sequencing 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes amplified from DNA directly retrieved from the samples. In combination with the mineralogical composition of the crusts and lipid analyses, sequence data were used to assess the possible role of prokaryotes in crust formation. Collectively, the obtained data showed the presence of highly diverse communities, which were distinct in each of the carbonate crusts studied. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were found in all crusts and the majority was classified as alpha-, gamma-, and delta- Proteobacteria. Interestingly, sequences of Proteobacteria related to Halomonas and Halovibrio sp., which can play an active role in carbonate mineral formation, were present in all crusts. Archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences were retrieved from two of the crusts studied. Several of those were closely related to archaeal sequences of organisms that have previously been linked to the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). However, the majority of archaeal sequences were not related to sequences of organisms known to be involved in AOM. In combination with the strongly negative delta C-13 values of archaeal lipids, these results open the possibility that organisms with a role in AOM may be more diverse within the Archaea than previously suggested. Different communities found in the crusts could carry out similar processes that might play a role in carbonate crust formation.

J	Li, ZQ; Yu, D; Xiong, W; Wang, D				Li, Zhongqiang; Yu, Dan; Xiong, Wen; Wang, Dong			Aquatic plants diversity in arid zones of Northwest China: patterns, threats and conservation	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						aquatic macrophyte; arid zones; biodiversity; China; cuonservation	BIODIVERSITY; MACROPHYTES; MANAGEMENT; AFRICA; FLORA; SOUTH	We investigated aquatic plant diversity by conducting the field investigation and collecting the published data in the arid regions of Northwest China. Two hundred and twenty four taxa of vascular aquatic plants representing 64 genera and 34 families occur in this area, 8.48% of which are endemic. Among these, 1 genus and 6 species were new state records and 1 family, 9 genera and 29 species were new area records. Typhaceae, Potamogetonaceae, Juncaginaceae and Haloragaceae were the most frequent families (considering relative frequency of occurrence), whereas Cyperaceae, Potamogetonaceae and Ranuncnlaceae are the most species-rich. The most frequent genera were Typha, Potamogeton, and Triglochin, and the most species-rich were Potamogeton, Eleocharis and Scirpus. The most frequent species are Triglochin palustre, Myriophyllum spicatum, Potamogeton pectinatus and Typha angustifolia. Aquatic plants diversity is distributed unevenly in the region. The maximum species occurs in Dzungarian basin while the least species in Hexi corridor. The aquatic flora in arid zone of China is not distinctive although some endemic species are found, most species are widely distributed. Local aquatic plants diversity can be influenced by many factors such as hydrological alteration, habitat loss, over-grazing, high human population pressure, global climate change, an inappropriate economic development policy. Among them, the largest threat to aquatic plants biodiversity may be habitat loss due to hydrological alteration. In order to conserve the aquatic plants biological resources and biodiversity in this region, some strategies and measures must be suggested including strengthening scientific research and biodiversity education in the local people, balancing economic development and ecological conservation, and enhancing governmental assistance and subsidy to the local residents.

Building phenological models from presence/absence data for a butterfly fauna	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						butterflies; California coast range; climate change; long-term monitoring; phenological modeling; phenology; potential aggregate species richness; presence/absence data	CLIMATE-CHANGE; BRITISH BUTTERFLIES; TRENDS; ABUNDANCE	Species phenology, is increasingly being used to explore the effects of climate change and other environmental stressors. Long-term monitoring data sets are essential for understanding both patterns manifest by individual species and more complex patterns evident at the community level. This study used records of 78 butterfly species observed on 626 days across 27 years at a site in northern California, USA, to build quadratic logistic regression models of the observation probability of each species for each day of the year. Daily species probabilities were summed to develop a potential aggregate species richness (PASR) model, indicating expected daily species richness. Daily positive and negative contributions to PASR were calculated, which can be used to target optimum sampling time frames. Residuals to PASR indicate a rate of decline of 0.12 species per year over the course of the study. When PASR was calculated for wet and dry years, wet years were found to delay group phenology by up to 17 days and reduce the maximum annual expected species from 32.36 to 30. Three tests to determine how well the PASR model reflected the butterfly fauna dynamics were all positive: We correlated probabilities developed with species presence/absence data to observed abundance by species, tested species' predicted phenological patterns against known biological characteristics, and compared the PASR curve to a spline-fitted curve calculated from the original species richness observations. Modeling individual species' flight windows was possible from presence/absence data, an approach that could be used on other similar records for butterfly communities with seasonal phenologies, and for common species with far fewer dates than used here. It also provided a method to assess sample frequency guidelines for other butterfly monitoring programs.

Species richness, area and climate correlates	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						area; climate correlate; Europe; grid cells; GAMs; grain; model accuracy; species richness; variable selection; 3D area	GLOBALLY CONSISTENT RELATIONSHIP; SPATIAL SCALE; TAXON RICHNESS; PATTERNS; DIVERSITY; ENERGY; MODELS; GRADIENTS; SELECTION; EUROPE	Aim Species richness-area theory predicts that more species should be found if one samples a larger area. To avoid biases from comparing species richness in areas of very different sizes, area is often controlled by counting the numbers of co-occupying species in near-equal area grid cells. The assumption is that variation in grid cell size accrued from working in a three-dimensional world is negligible. Here we provide a first test of this idea. We measure the surface area of c. 50 x 50 km and c. 220 x 220 km grid cells across western Europe. We then ask how variation in the area of grid cells affects: (1) the selection of climate variables entering a species richness model; and (2) the accuracy of models in predicting species richness in unsampled grid cells. Location Western Europe. Methods Models are developed for European plant, breeding bird, mammal and herptile species richness using seven climate variables. Generalized additive models are used to relate species richness, climate and area. Results:We found that variation in the grid cell area was large (50 x 50 km: 8-3311 km(2); 220 x 220: 193-55,100 km(2)), but this did not affect the selection of variables in the models. Similarly, the predictive accuracy was affected only marginally by exclusion of area within models developed at the c. 50 x 50 km grid cells, although predictive accuracy suffered greater reductions when area was not included as a covariate in models developed for c. 220 x 220 km grid cells. Main conclusions:Our results support the assumption that variation in near-equal area cells may be of second-order importance for models explaining or predicting species richness in relation to climate, although there is a possibility that drops in accuracy might increase with grid cell size. The results are, however, contingent on this particular data set, grain and extent of the analyses, and more empirical work is required.

Samples were collected from dredge catches carried out at I I stations at depths between 17 and 44 in in August/September 1993 during the TRANSDRIFT I cruise of the Russian R/V "Ivan Kireev." A total of 265 species were identified from the samples, mostly crustaceans (94). Species numbers per station ranged from 30 to 104. Macrobenthic community distribution clearly showed a depth zonation, consisting of a "Shallow" zone ( < 20 in), dominated by the crustaceans Mysis oculata (Mysidacea) and Saduria entomon (Isopoda) as well as molluscs, an "Intermediate" zone (20-30 in), characterised by a clear dominance of the bivalve Portlandia arclica, and a "Deep" zone (> 30 m) with bivalves P. arctica and Nuculoma bellotii as well as brittle stars Ophiocten sericeum and Ophiura sarsi being most abundant. According to a correlation analysis between faunal and environmental data a combination of duration of ice cover and water depth, respectively, showed the highest affinity to macrobenthic distribution. We conclude that the food input to the benthos, which is largely related to ice-cover regime, and the stress due to the pronounced seasonal salinity variability, which is primarily related to water depth, are prime determinants of macrobenthic community distribution and major causes of the prominent depth zonation in the Laptev Sea. Within the depth zones, sediment composition seems to be most significant in controlling the patterns in the distribution of the benthic fauna.

In 2002, we reexamined jaguar diet following two decades of mitigated human hunting of jaguar prey. We observed high overlap between historical and current jaguar diet constructs. Nine-banded armadillo remained the most frequently consumed prey item. However, collared peccary consumption increased by nearly 20 percent while dietary breadth decreased by 60 percent presumably reflecting increased prey availability following reduced human hunting pressure.

J	Abdullah, SA; Nakagoshi, N				Abdullah, Saiful Arif; Nakagoshi, Nobukazu			Changes in landscape spatial pattern in the highly developing state of Selangor, peninsular Malaysia	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article						tropical landscape; landscape pattern; land use; land use history; Malaysia	LAND-COVER CHANGES; LAGOON SYSTEM; USE DYNAMICS; RIVER-BASIN; MEXICO; FOREST; FRAGMENTATION; AREAS; USA; AQUACULTURE	In Malaysia, rapid changes in land use invariably portrayed have a relationship with environmental degradation. However, this has always been stated without any quantitative measurement for understanding the relationship in order to describe implications for land use planning and management. To understand the relationship this study addresses landscape pattern and landscape type responses to changes in land use in the state of Selangor, Malaysia as a case study. Three land use maps representing the years of 1966, 1981 and 1995 were used in this study. These maps were divided into 100 grid squares with each grid square has 10 km x 10 km dimension. These grid squares were used as a sampling unit for land use and landscape pattern change analyses. Based on proportion of land use categories, the landscape type of each grid square was determined. Results show that between 1966 and 1981 only one land use category significantly changed (p < 0.05) in its proportion compared to five land use categories between 1981 and 1995. This indicates that human land use intensity increased between 1981 and 1995. As response to the intensity of land use change, fragmentation (measured by number of patches and mean patch size metrics) and diversity (measured by relative patch richness metric) of the state's landscape increased from 1981 to 1995. Changes in land use also influenced the landscape types and its dynamic of change. Two categories of landscape types; human landscape (cropland, semi-natural and mixed landscapes) and natural landscape (forest and wetland landscapes) characterized the state landscape. Based on the number of grid squares human landscape increased over the period, whereas natural landscape decreased. Between 1966 and 1981, change from one landscape type to another was predominantly occurred in human landscape. Between 1981 and 1995, change was mainly occurred in the natural landscape. Developmental activities might have been less intense in the human landscape, but they had a much greater impact on the natural ecosystem. This study also revealed the potential of landscape type as a reference for land evaluation and complement to landscape metric as measurement for monitoring changes in a landscape. Finally, we conclude that it is important to understand the changes of land use intensification and its effects on landscape pattern as well as landscape types and their dynamic of change in order to describe the implications for land use planning and management.

Self-similar patterns of nature: insect diversity at local to global scales	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						insects; species diversity; self-similar patterns; local to global scales	BODY-SIZE; BRITISH BUTTERFLIES; POPULATION-DENSITY; EXTINCTION CRISIS; ABUNDANCE; ECOLOGY; LOSSES	The insects are probably the most hyperdiverse and economically important metazoans on the planet, but there is no consensus on the best way to model the dimensions of their diversity at multiple spatial scales, and the huge amount of information involved hinders data synthesis and the revelation of 'patterns of nature'. Using a sample of more than 600k insect species in the size range 1-100 mm, we analysed insect body sizes and revealed self-similar patterns persisting across spatial scales from several hectares to the World. The same patterns were found in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The patterns include: parallel rank-abundance distributions; flatter species-area curves in smaller insects-indicating their wider geographical distribution; the recurrence of the same species-rich family in the same body-size class at all spatial scales-which generates self-similar size-frequency distributions (SFDs)-and the discovery that with decreasing mean body size, local species richness represents an increasing fraction of global species richness. We describe how these 'rationalizing' patterns can be translated into methods for monitoring and predicting species diversity and community structure at all spatial scales.

Dietary contents from 4308 guts of those species collected during July 2003-May 2005 were examined. They were significantly grouped, based on similarity coefficient, into five feeding clusters (P < 0.01). Of these, most of the diets were dominated by calanoid copepods, shrimps, polychaetes and gammarid amphipods. Comparative study on two sillaginid species showed that both Sillago sihama and Sillago ingenuua were carnivores fed mainly on polychaetes and other benthic organisms. Dietary ontogenetic change of Sillago sihama was very distinctive where small sized classes started feeding mainly on calanoid copepods before changing almost completely to polychaetes. The two species applied both sharing and partitioning strategies for food, depending on size classes, to live with each other.

An equation of the form S = cA(z) describing more precisely the species-area relation for plant species in smaller area is proposed as a result of intensive examination of species presence. Several study and field data from a wild range of plant and animal taxa suggest that the slope, z, of a graph of the logarithm of species richness against the logarithm of area is not a constant to the grassland or woodland community. We collected replicated and randomized plant data at 6 spatial scales from 1 m(2) to 1 km(2) in the desert region of northwest China to identify the scale dependence in desert plant biodiversity. The results showed that the slope of the log-log plot varied systematically with spatial scale. The value of z was high (0.37) at small scales from 1 to 10 m(2) and it decreased with increased spatial scale subsequently. When spatial scales varied from 1 m(2) to 1 km(2), the value of z varied from 0.37 to 0.035, suggesting that desert plant diversity has strongly scale-dependence at the small scales (less than 100 m(2)). The result is different from the research of grassland and woodland communities.

General management principles and a checklist of strategies to guide forest biodiversity conservation	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Review						forest biodiversity conservation; general conservation and management principles; checklist of strategies	PONDEROSA PINE FORESTS; FOCAL-SPECIES APPROACH; OLD-GROWTH FORESTS; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE; BOREAL FORESTS; ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES; NATURAL DISTURBANCE; ARBOREAL MARSUPIALS; CRITICAL THRESHOLDS	Many indicators and criteria have been proposed to assess the sustainable management of forests but their scientific validity remains uncertain. Because the effects of forest disturbances (such as logging) are often specific to particular species, sites, landscapes, regions and forest types, management "shortcuts" such as indicator species, focal species and threshold levels of vegetation cover may be of limited generic value. We propose an alternative approach based on a set of five guiding principles for biodiversity conservation that are broadly applicable to any forested area: (1) the maintenance of connectivity; (2) the maintenance of landscape heterogeneity; (3) the maintenance of stand structural complexity; and (4) the maintenance of aquatic ecosystem integrity; (5) the use of natural disturbance regimes to guide human disturbance regimes. We present a checklist of measures for forest biodiversity conservation that reflects the multi-scaled nature of conservation approaches on forested land. At the regional scale, management should ensure the establishment of large ecological reserves. At the landscape scale, off-reserve conservation measures should include: (1) protected areas within production forests; (2) buffers for aquatic ecosystems; (3) appropriately designed and located road networks; (4) the careful spatial and temporal arrangement of harvest units; and (5) appropriate fire management practices. At the stand level, off-reserve conservation measures should include: (1) the retention of key elements of stand structural complexity (e.g., large living and dead trees with hollows, understorey thickets, and large fallen logs); (2) long rotation times (coupled with structural retention at harvest); (3) silvicultural systems alternative to traditional high impact ones (e.g., clearcutting in some forest types); and (4) appropriate fire management practices and practices for the management of other kinds of disturbances. Although the general ecological principles and associated checklist are intuitive, data to evaluate the effectiveness of many specific on-the-ground management actions are limited. Considerable effort is needed to adopt adaptive management "natural experiments" and monitoring to: (1) better identify the impacts of logging operations and other kinds of management activities on biodiversity, and; (2) quantify the effectiveness of impact mitigation strategies; and (3) identify ways to improve management practices.

J	Steele, CA; Storfer, A				Steele, Craig A.; Storfer, Andrew			Coalescent-based hypothesis testing supports multiple Pleistocene refugia in the Pacific Northwest for the Pacific giant salamander (Dicamptodon tenebrosus)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						coalescence; Columbia River; Dicamptodon; dispersal; Klamath-Siskiyou; phylogeography	TROUT SALVELINUS-CONFLUENTUS; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA VARIATION; GWAII GLACIAL REFUGIUM; CLADISTIC-ANALYSIS; PHENOTYPIC ASSOCIATIONS; POPULATION-GROWTH; GEOGRAPHICAL-DISTRIBUTION; AMBYSTOMA-TIGRINUM; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; TIGER SALAMANDER	Phylogeographic patterns of many taxa are explained by Pleistocene glaciation. The temperate rainforests within the Pacific Northwest of North America provide an excellent example of this phenomenon, and competing phylogenetic hypotheses exist regarding the number of Pleistocene refugia influencing genetic variation of endemic organisms. One such endemic is the Pacific giant salamander, Dicamptodon tenebrosus. In this study, we estimate this species' phylogeny and use a coalescent modeling approach to test five hypotheses concerning the number, location and divergence times of purported Pleistocene refugia. Single refugium hypotheses include: a northern refugium in the Columbia River Valley and a southern refugium in the Klamath-Siskiyou Mountains. Dual refugia hypotheses include these same refugia but separated at varying times: last glacial maximum (20 000 years ago), mid-Pleistocene (800 000 years ago) and early Pleistocene (1.7 million years ago). Phylogenetic analyses and inferences from nested clade analysis reveal distinct northern and southern lineages expanding from the Columbia River Valley and the Klamath-Siskiyou Mountains, respectively. Results of coalescent simulations reject both single refugium hypotheses and the hypothesis of dual refugia with a separation date in the late Pleistocene but not hypotheses predicting dual refugia with separation in early or mid-Pleistocene. Estimates of time since divergence between northern and southern lineages also indicate separation since early to mid-Pleistocene. Tests for expanding populations using mismatch distributions and 'g' distributions reveal demographic growth in the northern and southern lineages.

The estimation of dispersal rates using the covariance of local populations	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						time series analysis; autoregressive process; migration; dispersal rate; metapopulation	LONG-DISTANCE DISPERSAL; GENE FLOW; SPATIAL STRUCTURE; DYNAMICS; METAPOPULATION; SYNCHRONY; STABILITY; MODELS; CHAOS	Dispersal has important implications on an individual, population and metapopulation level. Dispersal rates, however, are difficult to measure. In this paper we introduce a method that uses census data, i.e. repeated counts of number of individuals per location and point in time, to estimate dispersal rates. The rationale underlying this method is that local stochastic disturbances which dissipate in subdivided populations create a covariance structure, the details of which depend on how strongly the local populations are coupled. This covariance structure can be used to estimate dispersal rates. We describe this process using a stochastic model for growth and dispersal which explicitly accounts for the geometry of the patchy population. A regression of the covariance structure of this model is then used to infer the growth rate near equilibrium and the dispersal rate. We study the distribution of the estimated parameters and obtain confidence intervals using a bootstrap analysis and a Monte Carlo technique. We study how the confidence intervals depend on the model's parameters, the robustness of the estimating scheme, and discuss the applicability of our method. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Niche evolution and adaptive radiation: Testing the order of trait divergence	ECOLOGY			English	Article						adaptive radiation; Ceanothus; Cerastes; Coast Range; community assembly; Euceanothus; habitat; niche conservatism; phylogenetic comparative methods; specific leaf area; Sierra Nevada; trait divergence; Transverse Range	PHYLOGENETICALLY INDEPENDENT CONTRASTS; GENUS CEANOTHUS RHAMNACEAE; MEADOW PLANT-COMMUNITIES; WORLD LEAF WARBLERS; CORRELATED EVOLUTION; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; MOLECULAR EVOLUTION; ABSOLUTE RATES; DIVERSIFICATION; CONSERVATISM	In the course of an adaptive radiation, the evolution of niche parameters is of particular interest for understanding modes of speciation and the consequences for coexistence of related species within communities. We pose a general question: In the course of an evolutionary radiation, do traits related to within-community niche differences (a niche) evolve before or after differentiation of macrohabitat affinity or climatic tolerances (beta niche)? Here we introduce a new test to address this question, based on a modification of the method of independent contrasts. The divergence order test (DOT) is based on the average age of the nodes on a tree, weighted by the absolute magnitude of the contrast at each node for a particular trait. The comparison of these weighted averages reveals whether large divergences for one trait have occurred earlier or later in the course of diversification, relative to a second trait; significance is determined by bootstrapping from maximum-likelihood ancestral state reconstructions. The method is applied to the evolution of Ceanothus, a woody plant group in California, in which co-occurring species exhibit significant differences in a key leaf trait (specific leaf area) associated with contrasting physiological and life history strategies. Co-occurring species differ more for this trait than expected under a null model of community assembly. This a niche difference evolved early in the divergence of two major subclades within Ceanothus, whereas climatic distributions (beta niche traits) diversified later within each of the subclades. However, rapid evolution of climate parameters makes inferences of early divergence events highly uncertain, and differentiation of the beta niche might have taken place. throughout the evolution of the group, without leaving a clear phylogenetic signal. Similar patterns observed in several plant and animal groups suggest that early divergence of a niche traits might be a common feature of niche evolution in many adaptive radiations.

Data from a long-term study of Papio hamadryas ursinus (L.) in the De Hoop Nature Reserve, Western Cape, South Africa, were used to test the assumptions and predictions of Altmann's model of maternal time budgets. 2. Female baboons' feeding time was below model predictions, and there was no evidence for a consistent increase in feeding time with infant age. In addition, female feeding time was not significantly higher than observed baseline feeding times for nonlactating females. 3. Female baboons reduced activity levels in the first few months post-partum, as reflected in significant increases in resting time, and there was some indication that females lost body mass over the course of lactation. When feeding demand was high, females sacrificed social time, and conserved resting time. 4. Females increased vigilance levels during the first 4 months of infant life and were more vigilant overall during lactation than when nonlactating. There was a negative relationship between feeding time and vigilance, but a positive relationship between resting time and vigilance. 5. Female baboons at De Hoop appear to cope with the energetic costs of lactation by reducing activity levels, although this cannot compensate completely for increased energetic costs. This may not be so much an 'energy-sparing' strategy as a response to threats presented by infanticidal males in this population. Females therefore trade-off feeding time against vigilance.

Because time and money are limited, it is useful to identify predictable relationships between measures of vegetation diversity or status, the physical environment, and disturbance; native and non-native plants may have different functional responses. Working towards development of effective, practical strategies for management and ecological restoration in the Spring Mountains, an isolated mountain range in the eastern Mojave Desert (Nevada, USA) that is a focus of regional conservation planning, we examined whether native and non-native assemblages of spring-associated perennial plants have predictable relationships with elevation, springbrook length, and various land uses. We also tested whether elevation, springbrook length, and overall disturbance were associated with the degree of predictability of local species presence and absence. Consistent with work in other systems, species richness and cover of native plants tended to decrease as intensity of disturbance increased, whereas species richness (but not cover) of non-native plants tended to peak with intermediate disturbance. Our results may suggest that invasions of non-native plants at springs in the Spring Mountains are relatively recent, and that rapid restoration and management actions may help protect ecological processes and viability of native plants. Ability to predict the order in which individual species are likely to be extirpated from or colonize springs was limited, perhaps reflecting considerable environmental heterogeneity among springs.

H. Whittaker's idea that plant diversity can be divided into a hierarchy of spatial components from alpha at the within-habitat scale through beta for the turnover of species between habitats to gamma along regional gradients implies the underlying existence of alpha, beta, and gamma niches. We explore the hypothesis that the evolution of a, (3, and gamma niches is also hierarchical, with traits that define the a niche being labile, while those defining a and 7 niches are conservative. At the a level we find support for the hypothesis in the lack of close significant phylogenetic relationship between meadow species that have similar a niches. In a second test, a niche overlap based on a variety of traits is compared between congeners and noncongeners in several communities; here, too, there is no evidence of a correlation between a niche and phylogeny. To test whether beta and gamma niches evolve conservatively, we reconstructed the evolution of relevant traits on evolutionary trees for 14 different clades. Tests against null models revealed a number of instances, including some in island radiations, in which habitat (beta niche) and elevational maximum (an aspect of the gamma niche) showed evolutionary conservatism.

Yet, rates and drivers of rural residential expansion into previously agricultural and natural landscapes have not been widely analyzed. Immigration and rural development have been exceptionally rapid in the private lands surrounding Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, known as the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem (GYE). Because the GYE has unique ecological value, is still largely undeveloped, and is currently characterized by unrestrictive land use policies, there are prime opportunities for improving regional growth management via the incorporation of scientific knowledge into local land use planning decisions. We quantified rates of growth in rural home construction in the GYE and considered the extent to which biophysical and socioeconomic factors explained variation in the spatial pattern of rural home development. We applied generalized linear models and use versus availability analyses to examine specific hypotheses regarding the potential drivers of rural residential development. From 1970 to 1999, the GYE experienced a 58% increase in population and a 350% increase in the area of rural lands supporting exurban housing densities. By 1999, one third of exurban developments were distributed in remote rural locations. Patterns of rural development within the GYE have been strongly influenced by agricultural suitability, transportation and services, natural amenities, past development patterns, and economic and recreational characteristics of nearby towns. The proportion of homes built on highly productive soils and lands proximate to water has remained consistently high throughout the 1900s. We suspect that newer homes continue to be built near water and productive soils because of the influence of early settlement patterns and transportation routes. Our data suggest that the more productive farmlands will likely continue to experience a disproportionate level of development pressure, as will the biologically diverse riparian habitats and the private lands bordering the national parks. This pattern of development has the potential to erode the quality of the lowland habitats most used by park wildlife. Although the possibility exists for continued land use intensification in the GYE, we emphasize the potential for local policy decisions to effectively manage growth in rural residential development.

With the advent and accessibility of large electronic databases of species and their life history and ecological attributes, ecologists have begun seeking generalities, and examining large-scale ecological hypotheses involving core themes of range, abundance and diversity. For example, combinations of ecological, life history and phylogenetic data have been analysed using large species sets to test hypotheses in invasion biology. Analysis of regional species inventories can contribute cogently to our understanding of invasions. Here we examine several ways in which database analysis is effective. We review 19 studies of comparative invasions biology, each using > 100 species of plants in their analyses, and show that invader success is linked to seven correlates: short life cycle, abiotic (mostly wind) dispersal, large native range size, non-random taxonomic patterns (emphasizing certain families or orders), presence of clonal organs, occupying disturbed habitats, and earlier time of introduction. These phylogenetically influenced, comparative analyses using regional species inventories are only just beginning and have much potential.

J	Fitzgerald, PC; Carlson, SJ				Fitzgerald, Paul C.; Carlson, Sandra J.			Examining the latitudinal diversity gradient in Paleozoic terebratulide brachiopods: should singleton data be removed?	PALEOBIOLOGY			English	Article							TAXONOMIC DIVERSITY; SPECIES RICHNESS; SAMPLING BIAS; FOSSIL RECORD; EXTINCTION; EVOLUTION; DISTRIBUTIONS; BIODIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; ORDOVICIAN	Studies of taxonomic diversity over time commonly count and compare first- and last-appearance data (FADs and LADs) over a succession of temporal intervals, and interpret them with respect to taxon origination and extinction. Singleton taxa, which first appear and last appear in the same temporal interval, are often removed from analyses because they might result from preservational biases rather than evolutionary processes, or they might represent non-independent FADs and LADs. Should singleton taxa always be excluded? We argue that in the case of Paleozoic terebratulide brachiopods, although they may be sensitive to biases in sampling intensity, singleton genera should be included in diversity studies because they do not appear to result from more typical biases, such as Lagerstatten and temporal interval length, that arguably can result in artificially high numbers of singleton genera. Singleton genera can be critical and effective when used to test hypotheses regarding the existence and generation of latitudinal diversity gradients. Contrary to the anti-tropical diversity pattern of modern articulated brachiopods, Paleozoic terebratulicles show a latitudinal diversity gradient that peaks in the Tropics. The hypothesis that the Tropics are either a diversity source or sink can be tested by comparing FAD and LAD latitudes. For singleton genera, FAD and LAD latitudes are taken from the same data points and must be removed for statistical comparisons to be valid. We suggest that taxon age distributions can accommodate singleton data, as the taxon age metric considers origination and extinction simultaneously. We generated taxon age distributions to test the hypothesis that the observed Paleozoic diversity gradient results from a latitudinal bias in generic turnover rate. We discovered that singletons are not randomly distributed over latitude, with proportionally more singleton genera occurring in the Tropics. In this case, singleton genera may reflect rapid evolutionary turnover of taxa, rather than simply preservational bias. Methods that can accommodate singleton taxa should be used to study the diversity of Paleozoic terebratulicles and possibly other well-skeletonized marine metazoans.

We explore what this concept of equivalence means in ecological communities, how such species may arise evolutionarily, and how the possibility of ecological equivalents relates to previous ideas about niche differentiation. We also show that the co-occurrence of ecologically similar or equivalent species is not incompatible with niche theory as has been supposed, because niche relations can sometimes favor coexistence of similar species. We argue that both evolutionary and ecological processes operate to promote the introduction and to sustain the persistence of ecologically similar and in many cases nearly equivalent species embedded in highly structured food webs. Future work should focus on synthesizing niche and neutral perspectives rather than dichotomously debating whether neutral or niche models provide better explanations for community structure and biodiversity.

An experiment was established in 1988 using three different seed treatments (legume and small understorey mix, small understorey mix only, and no seed) and two fertilizer treatments (N and P, and P only). The objectives of this study were to (1) document vegetation changes in the first 14 years after bauxite mining; (2) assess whether the vegetation is becoming more similar to the unmined forest; and (3) gain a better understanding of successional processes. Seed treatments significantly affected 13 of the 14 measured vegetation characteristics. Native species richness was higher in seeded than in unseeded sites at 1, 2, and 5 years of age, whereas diversity and evenness were generally higher at all assessment ages. Exotic species density was higher in unseeded than in seeded sites from 5 years onward, whereas richness was higher from 8 years onward. Nitrogen fertilizer significantly increased exotic species richness, density, and cover. Ephemerals dominated plant density in all rehabilitation treatments over time, whereas seeder species dominated cover. In contrast, resprouting species dominated density and cover in the unmined forest. Orchids were the only species that were not present in the first year in rehabilitated sites but increased in abundance over time. Vegetation composition in rehabilitated areas did not become more similar to the unmined forest during the 14 years since seeding, instead strongly reflected the initial species mix. Rehabilitated bauxite mines appear to follow the initial floristic composition model of succession.

One of these species, Echinochloa pyramidalis, has been introduced in the freshwater wetlands of the Mexican tropics. This alien species reduces biodiversity by replacing native species. The removal of non-indigenous species from invaded communities often requires different techniques such as physical, chemical, or biological controls. We evaluated the effects of mechanical (cutting or soil-disking) and chemical (spraying Round Up (TM) herbicide) disturbance treatments on the plant community of a freshwater marsh invaded by E. pyramidalis. We predicted that intense disturbance would eliminate this African grass from the experimental plots. Over a nine-month period, we analyzed species cover, richness, and diversity in experimental plots that received different disturbance treatments. Also, we measured the aerial biomass at the end of the experiment. The treatment that best reduced the dominance of E. pyramidalis and increased the diversity of native species was soil disking, but this was not enough to eliminate the grass. After nine months, E. pyramidalis recovered in all the treatments and again became the dominant species. To eliminate this species completely, it is necessary to recreate the natural topography and hydrology of the wetland and to select control mechanisms that disrupt those growth characteristics (e.g., rapid propagation from rhizomes and horizontal expansion via tillers) that make this grass more competitive than native species.

The Lake Kyoga satellite system lies downstream from Lake Victoria. It encompasses species-rich lakes where Nile perch are absent or very rare, and low diversity lakes where L. niloticus is abundant. In 1999 we surveyed seven lakes in the Kyoga system using experimental monofilament gill nets (1/4-1 inches variable mesh). At Boston University we assessed delta N-15 signatures of epaxial muscle from subsamples of the catch (n = 361). These signatures are often highly correlated with the near-term mean realized trophic position of an individual organism. A neural network analysis of fish length, species name, trophic level, and lake of origin fish explained 94% of the sample variance in delta N-15. We analysed statistical patterns in these signatures at a number of spatial scales. The relationship between trophic level and delta N-15 varied greatly among lakes. Higher diversity perch-free lakes had greater variance in delta N-15 values and fish lengths than lower diversity Nile perch lakes, suggesting an important relationship between species diversity and functional diversity. Against expectations, lake size was negatively correlated with delta N-15. Patterns in stable isotope signatures indicated that Nile perch lakes have shorter food chains than perch-free lakes. The results throw up two management problems for the Kyoga system. Impacted lakes need to be studied to understand and ameliorate the community-level effects of Nile perch introduction, whereas the species-rich nonperch lakes, which harbour a large proportion of the remaining diversity of regionally endemic taxa, are in need of conservation planning.

A rectangular grid of 1 m(2) sample plots was established; 25 replicate plots separated by a 3 m space were located along a 100 m long transect parallel to the contours, and there were 17 such transects separated by 20 m of altitude. Species were scored using a 7-grade cover scale and basic environmental data were gathered for each sample. Major changes occur over a short altitudinal range, at around 4400 m, which corresponds to a transition between the lower and upper superparamo. Species richness sharply declines but species turnover (per altitude) increases along the altitudinal gradient. The correlation between richness and bare ground or rock cover is negative, but the correlation to rocks becomes positive above 4500 m. Species from lower altitudes tend to have narrower altitudinal range, although a large number of species appear to be indifferent to altitude. Direct ordination analyses indicate that high-altitude species show stronger correlation to environmental variables, especially rock, than species from lower altitudes. TWINSPAN cluster analysis delimited 15 groups of samples. There is a change in the clustering pattern along the altitudinal gradient from a horizontal (i.e., within altitude) to vertical (i.e., across altitude) arrangement of the cluster groups, although this pattern is partly obscured at the highest altitudes due to a large number of empty samples. MANOVA tests for samples from adjacent altitudinal levels indicate two distinct altitudinal breaks at lower altitudes, corresponding to the Loricaria-belt in lower superparamo and the transition between lower and upper superparamo, while no indication of a zonation was found in upper superparamo.

The neutral theory of biodiversity provides a simple yet elegant explanation of species diversity patterns. By specifying speciation rates, dispersal and community size, and assuming that all individuals in a community are ecologically identical, the theory generates species abundance distributions that are remarkably similar to those observed in nature. 2. Here we show that incorporation of the Allee effect in a neutral community results in considerable decrease in species richness and radically different dominance-diversity curves, with an excess of both very abundant and very rare species but a shortage of intermediate species, than predicted by the current neutral model. 3. We also find that even a small Allee effect can cause a considerable decline in the time of species coexistence. However, dispersal limitation within a community indeed enhances coexistence as presumed by Hubbell's theory, but its effect is limited and is probably insufficient to negate the ubiquitous small-population disadvantages caused by the Allee effect and other agents alike. 4. The remarkably good fit between the predictions of neutral theory and certain observations implies that either the Allee effect is not important, which seems unlikely, or that other stabilizing mechanisms (i.e. rare species advantages, perhaps resulting from interspecific niche differentiation) oppose the Allee effect.

J	Bryant, MM				Bryant, MM			Urban landscape conservation and the role of ecological greenways at local and metropolitan scales	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article						urban ecological greenways; urban biodiversity; conservation strategies; National Biological Information Infrastructure; landscape conservation; landscape planning	CITY FORM; BIODIVERSITY; CORRIDORS; FLORA; NETWORKS; STRATEGY; AREAS	Greenways are promoted for land conservation in both rural and urban areas, but less attention has been paid to the potential of greenways to serve urban biodiversity conservation goals. This paper presents results of a biodiversity planning study of a highly urbanized environment in Washington, DC (USA) that demonstrate the critical role of ecological greenways and parks in urban species conservation. The Cameron Run study raises fundamental questions about the way biodiversity is defined in urban areas, the scale of analysis required in heterogeneous urban environments, the role of sociocultural factors in urban biodiversity conservation, and the importance of regional greenway connections across the urban gradient. The Cameron Run study is a pilot project for an urban biodiversity information node (UrBIN) in the National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) program of the US Geological Survey (USGS). This paper draws connections between the rapidly expanding literature on biodiversity conservation and the smaller, but growing, body of research concerning the ecology of greenways and urban areas, and it does so through the lens of landscape planning. Findings on the Cameron Run watershed are reported, and biodiversity conservation in the watershed is discussed in the context of greenway efforts at local and metropolitan scales.

We considered habitat loss, the breaking apart of habitat patches, and habitat structural alteration critical processes that affect species distribution and abundance. We evaluated the effects of these processes by considering the response of selected indicator species to isolation (landscape scale), patch size and edge effect (patch scale), and habitat structure (plot scale). We used broadleaf forests as our case-study ecosystem and birds as indicator species. Faunal data came from a georeferenced, long-term, breeding-bird database, and environmental data were obtained from field surveys and land-use digital cartography. Birds, grouped according to their sensitivity to patch isolation, patch size, edge effect, and habitat structure, indicated how environmental conditions affected species abundance. The most sensitive group to the above-mentioned processes included the Marsh Tit (Parus palustris), Nuthatch (Sitta europaea), and Short-toed Treecreeper (Certhia brachydactyla). We evaluated the umbrella effect of these species for the conservation of the other co-occurring birds and found that their effectiveness varied according to the criterion used to select sites for protection. Site selection based on indicator species identified forest patches with greater species abundance than an alternative criterion that chose sites based on patch isolation and size, edge effect, and forest structure. The alternative criterion, although not as efficient as indicator species, may nevertheless be useful and effective for conservation when faunal data are lacking and guidelines for habitat management or restoration are needed. Our method is applicable to other ecosystems and taxa because the processes we considered occur in many ecosystems and may have significant effects on species from all taxonomic groups.

First, we present a model of recruitment probabilities that combines both niche and neutral processes. From this model, we predict and test whether the relative importance of niche vs. neutral processes in controlling community dynamics will vary depending on community species richness, niche overlap and dispersal capabilities of species (both local and long distance). Results demonstrate that niche and neutrality form ends of a continuum from competitive to stochastic exclusion. In the absence of immigration, competitive exclusion tends to create a regular spacing of niches. However, immigration prevents the establishment of a limiting similarity. The equilibrium community consists of a set of complementary and redundant species, with their abundance determined, respectively, by the distribution of environmental conditions and the amount of immigration.

The diversity of plant species in field boundaries was found to be higher under organic than under conventional farming. Analysis of community patterns revealed that ruderal species and species with affinity to nutrient rich conditions were most common in conventional field borders, whereas stress-tolerant species were more abundant around organic farming. These differences occurred only 3-4 years after conversion to organic farming. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Genetic structures of shrubs and herbs, especially those with low densities, may be more sensitive to forest fragmentation. We studied the genetic structure of a self-compatible subshrub, Ardisia crenata var. bicolor (Myrsinaceae) in a recently fragmented landscape. Ten RAPD primers used for analysis generated a total of 76 bands. We found that A. c. var. bicolor had relatively low species-level (P-95 = 63.2%; H = 0.106; Shannon diversity index (SI) = 0.246) and within-population diversity (P-95 = 5.3-46.1%; H = 0.026-0.175; SI = 0.032-0.253), and significant population differentiation (G(ST) = 0.445). Significantly positive relationships were found between measures of diversity (P-95, H and SI) and the log of estimated population size. No significant relationship was observed between Nei's genetic distance and spatial distance of pairwise populations, indicating no isolation-by-distance. Given most species of forests are shrubs and herbs with short generation times, our observation indicated that distinct genetic consequences of recent fragmentation may be expected for quite a number of plant species.

J	Barko, VA; Herzog, DP; O'Connell, MT				Barko, VA; Herzog, DP; O'Connell, MT			Response of fishes to floodplain connectivity during and following a 500-year flood event in the unimpounded upper Mississippi River	WETLANDS			English	Article						LTRMP; floodpulse; large river; NMDS; invasive; carp	SAN-JUAN RIVER; PATTERNS; WETLAND; COMMUNITIES; DISTURBANCE; DOWNSTREAM; ASSEMBLAGE; DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; RECOVERY	We examined data collected on fish assemblage structure among three differing floodplain types (broad, moderate, and narrow) during the 1993 flood in the unimpounded reach of the upper Mississippi River. This 500 year flood event provided a unique opportunity to investigate fish-floodplain function because the main river channel is otherwise typically disjunct from approximately 82% of its floodplain by an extensive levee system. Fishes were sampled during three separate periods, and 42 species of adult and young-of-the-year (YOY) fishes were captured. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) revealed a significant and distinguishable difference between both adult and YOY assemblage structure among the three floodplain types. Analysis of variance revealed that Secchi transparency, turbidity, water velocity, and dissolved oxygen were significantly different among the floodplain types. However, only depth of gear deployment and Secchi transparency were significantly correlated with adult assemblage structure. None of these variables were significantly correlated with YOY assemblage structure. The numerically abundant families (adult and YOY catches combined) on the floodplain included Centrarchidae, Ictularidae, and Cyprinidae. Both native and non-native fishes were captured on the floodplain, and several of the numerically abundant species that were captured on the floodplain peaked in catch-per-unit-effort 1-3 years after the 1993 flood event. This suggests that some species may have used flooded terrestrial habitat for spawning, feeding, or both. The findings from our study provide much needed insight into fish-floodplain function in a temperate, channelized river system and suggest that lateral connectivity of the main river channel to less degraded reaches of its floodplain should become a management priority not only to maintain faunal biodiversity but also potentially reduce the impacts of non-native species in large river systems.

Using biological inventory data and an inventory-based conservation plan as benchmarks, we evaluated the potential effectiveness of a focal species plan and three "simple" plans (large forested patches, close to wetlands and riparian areas, diverse forest types). Effectiveness was measured in three ways: the number of inventory elements captured at least once by the plan (representation), the total number of inventory elements captured (completeness), and the proportion of land in the inventory-based plan included (overlap). We further examined the potential effectiveness of the simple plans by calculating their overlap with land identified by the focal species approach. The simple and focal species plans did not differ markedly in terms of representation, but diverged when completeness and overlap were considered. Although representation rates for all four plans were relatively high, lower rates for completeness and overlap raise concerns about long-term viability. The simple plans did not identify the same lands as the focal species plan, and are thus unlikely to provide appropriate habitat for the focal species. Each approach we tested failed to capture some subset of species and communities, highlighting the importance of explicit conservation targets and consideration of ecological processes. Forced to act quickly and with little data, our findings suggest using initially a set of complementary simple plans, each focused on a different habitat type. This should be considered a stopgap measure, however, while more sophisticated plans are constructed, defining explicit conservation targets and considering ecological processes.

We tested general vs. local population adaptation to host cultivars, by characterizing a French collection of Phytophthora infestans (the causal organism of potato late blight) sampled during two consecutive years on cultivars exhibiting various levels of resistance. Local populations were structured by the host for virulence (qualitative pathogenicity) but also for aggressiveness (quantitative pathogenicity). All populations had a low genotypic diversity for amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), and presumably consisted of a few closely related clonal lineages. No correlation was detected between pathogenicity traits and AFLP genotypes. The data support the hypothesis of general adaptation for aggressiveness, to which directional selection for virulence is superimposed when race-specific resistance is introduced.

Most forested areas within these landscapes now show increased susceptibility to stand-replacing fires, insect outbreaks, and drought-related mortality. Recent large wildfires in the region have spurred public interest in large-scale fuel reduction and restoration programs, which create perceived and real conflicts with the conservation of biodiversity. Conservation concerns include the potential for larger road networks, soil and understory disturbance, exotic plant invasion, and the removal of large trees in treated areas. Pursuing prescribed burning, thinning, or other treatments on the broad scale that many scientists and managers envision requires the reconciliation of ecological restoration with biodiversity conservation. This study presents recommendations from a workshop for integrating the principles and practices of restoration ecology and conservation biology, toward the objective of restoring the composition, structure, and function of dry ponderosa pine forests. Planning on the scale of hundreds of thousands of hectares offers opportunities to achieve multiple objectives (e.g., rare species protection and restoration of ecological structures and processes) that cannot easily be addressed on a site-by-site basis. However, restoration must be coordinated with conservation planning to achieve mutual objectives and should include strict guidelines for protection of rare, declining, and sensitive habitats and species.

Vascular plants at 50 sites on road verges were compared with those plant communities in the adjacent grazed rangelands. Verges were found to support a greater mean number of species, total plant cover, and number of individual plants. Road verges were found to contain 11 unique species compared with 20 unique species in rangelands. Plant community composition varied with more forbs and succulents on the verge and more shrubs in the rangeland. Significantly greater cover of unpalatable plants was found on the ungrazed road verge, and no difference in palatable and highly palatable plant cover was recorded, indicating that herbivory is not a major driver in defining community differences in these environments. No significant differences in soil moisture or texture were found between verge and rangeland. We argue that road maintenance and construction activities have an over-riding controlling influence on road verge community composition. Although it is not possible to discount the possibility that road verges provide an important refuge for certain species, it appears that they are disturbed environments that do not contribute significantly to the plant conservation needs of this biome.

The stomach contents of 43 specimens revealed 24 items, 22 were arthropods and two were vegetal material. Numerically, ants comprized the greater percentage of the stomach contents (49.7%) followed by homopterans (16.7%) and hemipterans (12.8%). Volumetrically, beetles were the most important item (42.4%). There was a linear relationship between SVL and stomach volume, SVL and snout length, and snout length and length of one prey group (Hemiptera). In comparison with northern populations which feed primarily on termites, it is possible that toads in this population will need more than seven feedings to survive for one year.

Design elements created non-ideal denitrification conditions by diminishing an organic carbon source (emergent vegetation) and increasing sediment exposure to oxygen. SJWS aqueous nitrogen and avian data (1999-2002) were analyzed to discern whether design and operating conditions allowed for simultaneous nitrate removal and diverse, abundant avian habitat. Average TIN removal efficiency was 80% while average TN removal efficiency was 60%; the difference reflects Org-N production in the marsh. Based on Chl-a measurements, roughly 40% of Org-N produced in the system was present as algae. The highest annual nitrate removal rates occurred April-May (350-500 mg/m(2)/d) and September-October (250-425 mg/m(2)/d). First order rate constants ranged 30.7-47.5 m year(-1). Seasonal plantings of barnyard grass (Echinocloa crus-galli) were intended to serve as a carbon amendment for denitrification, however, there was no difference in nitrate removal between amended and non-amended conditions, likely because data averaging obscured a small, localized enhancement signal. Average avian species richness was high, ranging between 65 and 76 species month(-1), while average relative abundance was mid-range, at 65-83 birds ha(-1) month(-1). Birds observed included common and rare species. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Verhoeven, KJF; Jannink, JL; McIntyre, LM				Verhoeven, KJF; Jannink, JL; McIntyre, LM			Using mating designs to uncover QTL and the genetic architecture of complex traits	HEREDITY			English	Article						diallel; QTL; simulations; power; GCA; SCA	PARTIAL DIALLEL CROSSES; QUANTITATIVE TRAIT; LINE CROSSES; MAIZE POPULATIONS; ALLELIC NUMBER; LOCI; METAANALYSIS; RESISTANCE; FAMILIES; MODEL	Analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting complex traits is often pursued in single-cross experiments. For most purposes, including breeding, some assessment is desired of the generalizability of the QTL findings and of the overall genetic architecture of the trait. Single-cross experiments provide a poor basis for these purposes, as comparison across experiments is hampered by segregation of different allelic combinations among different parents and by context-dependent effects of QTL. To overcome this problem, we combined the benefits of QTL analysis ( to identify genomic regions affecting trait variation) and classic diallel analysis ( to obtain insight into the general inheritance of the trait) by analyzing multiple mapping families that are connected via shared parents. We first provide a theoretical derivation of main ( general combining ability (GCA)) and interaction ( specific combining ability (SCA)) effects on F-2 family means relative to variance components in a randomly mating reference population. Then, using computer simulations to generate F-2 families derived from 10 inbred parents in different partial-diallel designs, we show that QTL can be detected and that the residual among-family variance can be analyzed. Standard diallel analysis methods are applied in order to reveal the presence and mode of action ( in terms of GCA and SCA) of undetected polygenes. Given a fixed experiment size ( total number of individuals), we demonstrate that QTL detection and estimation of the genetic architecture of polygenic effects are competing goals, which should be explicitly accounted for in the experimental design. Our approach provides a general strategy for exploring the genetic architecture, as well as the QTL underlying variation in quantitative traits.

Early ontogenetic diet in Gray Wolves, Canis lupus, of coastal British Columbia	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST			English	Article						Gray wolf; Canis lupus; Sitka Black-tailed Deer; Odocoileus hemionus; provisioning; pups; diet; British Columbia	NICHE OVERLAP; TRADE-OFFS; RED FOXES; FOOD; QUALITY; DEER	Within populations, different age classes often consume dissimilar resources, and provisioning of juveniles by adults is one mechanism by which this can occur. Although the diet of Gray Wolves (Canis lupus) has been studied extensively, the diet of pups is largely unknown. We examined faeces deposited by altricial pups and adult providers during the first two months following birth at two den sites over two years on the central coast of British Columbia, Canada. Pups and adult wolves consumed similar species, and Black-tailed Deer (Odocoileus hemionus) constituted most of the diet for both age groups. Pup and adult diet, however, diverged. Specifically, adult deer occurred significantly less frequently in the diet of pups than in the diet of adult wolves, which suggests that adults selectively provisioned pups. We speculate that this may relate to adaptive strategies of adult wolves to provide their offspring with food of optimal nutritional value or reduced parasitic burden, and/or logistic factors associated with provisioning such as prey transportability and availability.

J	Kuhn, I; Klotz, S				Kuhn, I; Klotz, S			Urbanization and homogenization - Comparing the floras of urban and rural areas in Germany	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						alien plant species; biotic homogenization; Germany; native plant species; urbanization	BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION; SPECIES RICHNESS; LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE; UNITED-STATES; FISH FAUNAS; DIVERSITY; PLANTS; ALIEN; BIODIVERSITY; PATTERNS	The process of urbanization has resulted in an expansion of alien plant species and declines of native species, in particular already rare species. These processes may cause a greater similarity between different urban regions, i.e. biotic homogenization. We explored the relationship between urban regions and homogenization for plant species in Germany using (i) all plant species, (ii) only native species, (iii) all alien species and only those introduced (iv) before or (v) after 1500, respectively. We used the database FLORKART for species distribution on a 6 min latitude x 10 min longitude (ca. 130 km(2)) scale. We calculated mean similarities for the 60 "most urbanized" cells. We then resampled 60 randomly drawn "less urbanized" cells and 60 "rural" cells and compared these results to the "most urbanized" cells taking distance effects into account. Urbanization does not have an overall effect on homogenization of all species, but native species as well as pre-1500 alien plant assemblages show effects of homogenization while post-1500 alien plant assemblages show the opposite effect. On a regional scale, urbanization is not unequivocally related to homogenization. This might be different when extending the analysed range across several bioclimatic regions. Specific urban habitats, or what remains of them, require special protection and management if the trend towards homogenization is to be avoided. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, it is one of the areas in Brazil where the local fauna is less assessed, thus needing more scientific information that could allow political decisions to be made regarding conservation. The continuous pressure for new pasture areas leads to improper habitat occupation and destruction, like fragmentation of forest areas in the region. Such alterations can cause different impacts on the local fauna, including the soil arthropods. The main objective of this work was to compare the morphospecies composition, diversity and density of the soil arthropod fauna between a secondary single species forest (Cambarazal) and a cultivated pasture with exotic and native grass species, using only pitfall traps as sampling method. We found a great variation on the vegetal cover among environments. A higher humidity in the forest soil was observed, as well as a greater compaction of the soil in the cultivated pasture. A total of 3635 individuals were collected, belonging to 214 different morphospecies. 139 morphospecies were collected in the forest (37% exclusive to this environment), while 134 morphospecies were collected in the cultivated pasture (35% exclusive). The diversity was higher in the forest (H' = 1.634) than in the cultivated pasture (H'= 1.253). However, considering the area as a whole (forest and pasture) the global diversity was increased.

(Restionaceae), an endemic genus of the Cape Floristic Region. We assess two methods of scoring the data (presence-absence in regular grids, or in irregular eco-geographical regions) and three methods for locating biogeographical centres or areas of endemism, and evaluate one method for locating biotic elements. Location The Cape Floristic Region (CFR), South Africa. Methods The distribution of all 48 species of Elegia was mapped as presence-absence data on a quarter-degree grid and on broad habitat units (eco-geographical areas). Three methods to delimit areas of endemism were applied: parsimony analysis of endemism (PAE), phenetic cluster analysis, and NDM ('endemism'). In addition, we used presence-absence clustering ('Prabclus') to delimit biotic elements. The performances of these methods in elucidating the geographical patterns in Elegia were compared, for both types of input data, by evaluating their efficacy in maximizing the proportion of endemics and the number of areas of endemism. Results Eco-geographical areas perform better than quarter-degree grids. The eco-geographical areas are potentially more likely to track the distribution of species. The phenetic approach performed best in terms of its ability to delimit areas of endemism in the study area. The species richness and the richness of range-restricted species are each highest in the south-western part of the CFR, decreasing to the north and east. The phytogeographical centres identified in the present study are the northern mountains, the southern mountains (inclusive of the Riviersonderend Mountains and the Cape Peninsula), the Langeberg range, the south coast, the Cape flats, and the west coast. Main conclusions This study demonstrates that (1) eco-geographical areas should be preferred over a grid overlay in the study of biogeographical patterns, (2) phenetic clustering is the most suitable analytical method for finding areas of endemism, and (3) delimiting biotic elements does not contribute to an understanding of the biogeographical pattern in Elegia. The areas of endemism in Elegia are largely similar to those described in other studies, but there are many detailed differences.

Data from a variety of available databases were aggregated at the county level to examine patterns in county population density and growth in relation to floristic change. Based on population, California was divided into three zones: high (n = 9; 257-1320 people/km(2)), medium (n = 25; 28-177 people/km(2)), and low (n = 24; 1-24 people/km(2)) density counties. Examining patterns of rare plant occurrences among these counties revealed that high and medium density counties contained, on average, as many or more rare and endemic species than low density counties. The largest pool of these species, 48 percent of the 962 highly threatened taxa in California, is restricted to high and medium density counties. Thus, urban and urbanizing counties play a strategic role in maintaining a part of California's flora that is both globally significant and threatened with extinction. Examining species losses and noxious weed additions across high density counties, reveals a consistent pattern of low similarity among species that have been extirpated from high density counties and a high similarity among noxious weeds that these counties now share. The consequence is that California's urban county floras appear to be homogenizing. Examining homogenization using the entire flora for urban counties demonstrates that less similar counties become more similar. The effect of loss of rare species could outweigh the gain in exotics, under an assumption of strong extinction. Finally, a strong negative relationship between population density and the proportion of county land in public ownership suggests that high and medium density counties are in a poor position to protect rare plant populations on a localized basis.

J	Sfenthourakis, S; Tzanatos, E; Giokas, S				Sfenthourakis, S; Tzanatos, E; Giokas, S			Species co-occurrence: the case of congeneric species and a causal approach to patterns of species association	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						assembly rules; competition; community structure; co-occurrence; macroecology; species association	NULL MODEL ANALYSIS; TERRESTRIAL ISOPODS ISOPODA; BIOGEOGRAPHY; ALGORITHMS; MATRICES; ISLANDS; MAMMALS; ARCHIPELAGO; COMMUNITIES; NESTEDNESS	Aim To test whether congeneric species are significantly associated with one another in space, either positively or negatively. Also, to provide a framework for a causal investigation of co-occurrence patterns by a parallel comparison of interactions in geographical and ecological data matrices. Location For the analysis of congeneric species' co-occurrences we used 30 matrices covering a wide range of taxa and geographical areas, while for the causal investigation we used the distribution of 50 terrestrial isopod species on 20 islands and 264 sampling stations in the central Aegean archipelago, as well as a number of ecological variables for each sampling station. Methods We developed a software program (COOC) that incorporates the species-by-species approach to co-occurrence analysis using EcoSim's output of prior null model analysis of co-occurrence. We describe this program in detail, and use it to investigate one of the most common assembly rules, namely, the decreased levels of co-occurrence among congeneric species pairs. For the causal analysis, we proceed likewise, cross-checking the results from the geographical and the ecological matrices. There is only one possible combination of results that can support claims for direct competition among species. Results We do not get any strong evidence for widespread competition among congeneric species, while most communities investigated do not show significant patterns of species associations. The causal analysis suggests that the principal factors behind terrestrial isopod species associations are of historical nature. Some exceptional cases are also discussed. Main conclusions Presence/absence data for a variety of taxa do not support the assembly rule that congeneric species are under more intense competition compared to less related species. Also, these same data do not suggest strong interactions among species pairs, regardless of taxonomic status. When significant species associations can be seen in such matrices, they mainly reflect the effects of history or of habitat requirements.

The dietary components of these specimens were used to calculate dietary overlap between the 2 species and to determine if changes in overlap existed between sympatric and allopatric populations. To statistically test overlap values, a randomization algorithm was used to construct a simulated data matrix (i.e., null model) in order to compare observed values of dietary overlap to a distribution of overlap values from the null model. Significant levels (P < 0.05) of dietary overlap occurred in all cases of sympatry as well as allopatry. Average dietary overlap in sympatry was significantly lower than in allopatry, suggesting a dietary shift when in sympatry to reduce competition. Diet composition also differed between sympatric and allopatric populations of each species, further suggesting a partitioning of food resources by one or both species when in the presence of its congener.

This pattern has numerous implications for both theory and conservation in much the same way as the species-area relationship (SAR). However, the STR has received much less attention and to date only a handful of papers have been published on the pattern. Here we gather together 984 community time-series, representing 15 study areas and nine taxonomic groups, and evaluate their STRs in order to assess the generality of the STR, its consistency across ecosystems and taxonomic groups, its functional form, and its relationship to local species richness. In general, STRs were surprisingly similar across major taxonomic groups and ecosystem types. STRs tended to be well fit by both power and logarithmic functions, and power function exponents typically ranged between 0.2 and 0.4. Communities with high richness tended to have lower STR exponents, suggesting that factors increasing richness may simultaneously decrease turnover in ecological systems. Our results suggest that the STR is as fundamental an ecological pattern as the SAR, and raise questions about the general processes underlying this pattern. They also highlight the dynamic nature of most species assemblages, and the need to incorporate time scale in both basic and applied research on species richness patterns.

Comparative analysis of the feeding ecology of two pelagic forage fishes: capelin Mallotus villosus and walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						capelin; age-0 walleye pollock; diet overlap; prey selectivity	PRINCE-WILLIAM-SOUND; GULF-OF-ALASKA; BERING-SEA; BARENTS SEA; NORTHERN GULF; WESTERN GULF; ZOOPLANKTON ABUNDANCE; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; PROXIMATE COMPOSITION; PRIBILOF ISLANDS	Pelagic forage fishes are an important component in the transfer of trophic energy in marine ecosystems. Capelin Mallotus villosus and age-0 walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma are pelagic forage fishes whose alternate fluctuations in abundance have been associated with system-wide biotic reorganization of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) ecosystem. To better understand differences between these fishes, we compared their feeding ecology using samples of similar-sized (39 to 126 mm) individuals collected together in midwater trawl hauls during September 2000 to 2001 in the western GOA. Zooplankton samples were used to characterize prey availability. The comparative analysis focused on diet, feeding chronology, daily ration, and prey selectivity. The diet of both species mostly consisted of small copepods, large copepods, adult and juvenile euphausiids, thecosome pteropods, and larvaceans; consequently, the overall diet overlap was high. The diet overlap of fish from some samples, however, was low. Capelin fed mostly during crepuscular periods while pollock mostly fed at night. The daily ration estimate for capelin was low (1.8% body weight [BW]) relative to pollock (5.2% BW). Chesson's index of selectivity indicated preferential selection of euphausiids (adult and juvenile) by capelin and age-0 pollock. At euphausiid-poor locations, capelin stomachs were mostly empty while pollock stomachs contained alternate prey. Selectivity of amphipods, large copepods, larvaceans, and reptantians was higher for age-0 pollock than for capelin. Consumption of euphausiids increased with their abundance in the plankton, and consumption: biomass ratios indicate that localized depletion could occur. We hypothesize that capelin increase foraging mobility while age-0 pollock switch to alternate prey as a competitive response to limited euphausiid availability.

Global prediction of planktic foraminiferal fluxes from hydrographic and productivity data	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Review							SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; CANARY-ISLANDS REGION; SOUTH ATLANTIC-OCEAN; PERU-CHILE CURRENT; DEEP-WATER FLUXES; ART. NO. 1065; SEDIMENT TRAPS; PARTICLE FLUXES; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; SARGASSO SEA	Understanding and quantifying the seasonal and spatial distribution of planktic foraminiferal fluxes reflected in sedimentary assemblages is key to interpret foraminiferabased proxies in paleoceanography. Towards this goal we present an empirical model to predict foraminiferal fluxes on a global scale. A compilation of planktic foraminiferal flux and export production data from globally distributed sediment traps together with environmental data of sea-surface temperature and mixed-layer depth from online databases is used to calibrate the model that calculates monthly foraminiferal fluxes for the 18 most common species. The calibrated model is then forced with a global data set of hydrographic and productivity data to predict monthly foraminiferal fluxes worldwide. The predictive skills of the model are assessed by comparing the model output with planktic foraminiferal assemblages from globally distributed surface sediments as well as with measured foraminiferal fluxes of sediment traps not included in the calibration data set. Many general distribution patterns of foraminiferal species recognized from the model output compare favorably with observations from coretops or sediment traps, even though the model still produces problematic results in some places. Among others, meridional gradients in species richness and diversity, increased relative abundances of Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (dex.) in upwelling areas, and peak abundances of Globigerinella siphonifera in oligotrophic subtropical gyres show good agreement between model and coretops. Absolute foraminiferal fluxes are significantly underestimated in most cases, while seasonal variations can be reproduced for some species. Interannual differences in foraminiferal fluxes are not reflected by the model which might partly be due to a lack of actual environmental data for the calibration and model experiments. The limited predictive skills of the model suggest that additional parameters should be considered. Export production should probably be replaced by a more realistic representation of food availability for planktic foraminifera. This could be achieved by adding a dynamic component to the model and linking it to an ecosystem model.

Habitat extent, composition and management on organic farms was likely to favour higher levels of biodiversity and indeed organic farms tended to support higher numbers of species and overall abundance across most taxa. However, the magnitude of the response varied; plants showed larger and more consistent responses than other taxa. Variation in response across taxa may be partly a consequence of the small size and isolated context of many organic farms. Extension of organic farming could contribute to the restoration of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.

This was done using nonlinear canonical analyses of principal coordinates (NCAP). The volume of the holdfast is a proxy for the age of the plant and.. thus, the canonical axis is a proxy for succession in the marine invertebrate community inhabiting the holdfast. Analyses were done at several different taxonomic resolutions on the basis of various dissimilarity measures. Assemblages in relatively large holdfasts demonstrated ongoing variation in community structure with increasing volume when the dissimilarity used was independent of sample size. Smaller holdfasts had proportionately greater abundances of ophiuroids and encrusting organisms (bryozoans, sponges, ascidians) while larger holdfasts were characterised by proportionately greater abundances of crustaceans, polychaetes and molluscs. Such linear and nonlinear multivariate models may be applied to analyse system-level responses to the growth of many habitat-forming organisms, such as sponges, coral reefs.. coralline algal turf or forest canopies.

Aquatic invertebrate density, distribution, and richness were investigated at 29 study sites distributed laterally (main channel-floodplain) among 6 geomorphologically distinct river readies from the headwaters to near the mouth of one of the last seminatural river corridors draining the European Alps, the Tagliamento River in northeastern Italy. Community relationships were examined using multivariate and diversity analyses to investigate patterns of taxonomic richness. Diversity parameters were scaled at the site, reach, and catchment levels to better understand local and regional patterns. Mean invertebrate density increased from 7484 +/- 2480 ( +/- 1 SE) individuals/m(2) in the headwaters to 98,811 +/- 18,037 individuals/m(2) on the lowland floodplain. Crustacea, Coleoptera, and Ephemeroptera richness increased and nonchironomid Diptera and Plecoptera richness declined along the corridor. Richness (a diversity) and turnover (P diversity) showed no consistent increase or decrease along connectivity gradients within geomorphic readies along the river corridor, possibly because each reach had unique characteristics. a diversity was similar among geomorphic reaches along the corridor, whereas P diversity between reaches increased as a function of distance between them. Direct gradient analysis indicated high taxa-to-environment concordance along lateral (i.e., floodplain water bodies) and longitudinal (upstream-downstream) dimensions and indicated distinct floodplain communities. These results demonstrate how lateral gradients (floodplain dimension) structure zoobenthic communities and how this structure can change along the longitudinal dimension (upstream-downstream). Our results highlight the importance of off-channel environments to macroinvertebrate community structure and diversity. Conservation, restoration, and preservation measures must consider the lateral dimension along river corridors as integral to maintaining diversity and community structure.

A GIS-based approach utilizing simple models was used to assess existing biophysical data relative to these criteria for conservation system planning in Nova Scotia, Canada, with potential utility in applications elsewhere. Representative samples of natural landscapes were identified on the basis of size ( : 10 000 ha) and degree of naturalness (natural-cover, uneven-aged forests, low or zero road density). Special elements were selected, including hotspots of diversity and rarity, critical habitat for species at risk, significant wetlands, old and unique forests, and ecosites. Habitat requirements of viable populations of focal species (American moose, American marten, and Northern Goshawk) were identified using species distribution data, habitat suitability, and population viability analyses. Priority core. areas for biodiversity conservation system planning were identified on the basis of these three sets of criteria. Key areas of habitat connectivity were delineated by selecting the least-cost paths for focal species between relevant core areas through cost-distance. analyses based on habitat suitability, road density, and minimum corridor width. Collectively, these biodiversity considerations indicate that similar to 60% of Nova Scotia, including 32% in core areas, should be managed for conservation objectives to maintain genes, species, and ecosystems over time. Although data and modeling limitations require that our analysis of richness and diversity, habitat suitability, population viability, and core area selection be verified, the area calculations and other results are consistent with those in similar studies. Consequently, the system design and other information generated are useful for local and regional biodiversity conservation planning and management, and the methodological approach is of potential use in other regions where the necessary field-based data may be made available.

Even though there were significant autocorrelations among spectral indices, there were significant differences in the relationships between spectral indices and forest attributes. IRI was not significantly correlated with any of the structural variables while MIRI was correlated with canopy closure and NDVI values were correlated with canopy Closure as well is annual woody increment. NDVI and MIRI were both related to relative tree diversity and all three indices were associated with aspects of tree species composition. Based on the results of this study, it appears that spectral indices, and in particular NDVI, may be useful indicators of forest attributes in tropical dry forest habitats. Further research needs to be undertaken to identify if the results of this study can be applied to other tropical dry forests at a global spatial scale.

Mice appear capable of locally extirpating moths since mice exert high predation pressure on sparse pupae and are numerically decoupled from moth populations. Nevertheless, during 23 years of monitoring, moths persisted at scales > I ha despite frequent extinctions at smaller spatial scales. We hypothesized that spatially heterogeneous intensity-in mouse foraging and/or limited moth dispersal might allow moth persistence. Using a spatially explicit, individual-based, empirically parameterized model, we show that neither spatially heterogeneous predation by mice, nor limited moth dispersal alone allows moth persistence at typical mouse densities. However, synergy between both factors allows moth population persistence at naturally Occurring Mouse densities. For example, in models with 40 mice/ha, both limited moth dispersal with spatially homogeneous predation risk and spatially heterogeneous predation risk with unlimited moth dispersal had a 0% chance of moth persistence, but the combination of limited dispersal and heterogeneous predation risk resulted in a similar to 75% chance of moth persistence. Furthermore, both for limited moth dispersal with spatially homogeneous predation risk and for spatially heterogeneous predation risk with unlimited moth dispersal, moth persistence was only guaranteed at very low mouse densities, while the combination of limited moth dispersal with heterogeneous predation guaranteed moth persistence within a broad range of mouse densities. The findings illustrate a novel mechanism of "spatial selection and satiation" that can enhance rare species persistence under intense incidental predation by generalist predators.

While such models can reproduce urban sprawl, they do not address such fundamental issues as the causes of initial human settlement locations, variation in the growth rates of different urban centers, and the ecological consequences of different economic drivers. A complementary approach, based on properties of the environment related to net primary productivity, predicts the temporal and spatial patterns of development and land-use change associated with three distinct phases of economic development agricultural, industrial, and information/communication. Initial land-use patterns, established in response to environmental constraints on agriculture, are selectively amplified based on the subsequent requirements for industrialization. These environmental constraints are later relaxed during the information/communication phase of development, which affects portions of the landscape that were little affected by the first two phases. This sequence of events produces a predictable change in the distribution of human population density and land-use intensity that impacts different components of biodiversity over time. The agricultural phase tends to eliminate those components of biodiversity that depend on high-productivity environments, while preserving those components that can survive on marginal lands. However, the transition from an industrial to an information-driven economy breaks the linkage between productivity and land-use intensity, and allows intensification of human impacts in areas that had been protected by the constraints imposed by agricultural and industrial economies. As a consequence, the remaining reservoirs of biodiversity on marginal lands are now being threatened as formerly remote rural areas are being developed for recreational and residential use, particularly in the western United States.

Defining characteristics of the ecosystem are 1) abundant large vertebrates and aquatic prey bases, 2) animals with large spatial requirements, 3) healthy, dynamically sustainable estuaries, 4) oligotrophic freshwater wetlands, and 5) complex landscape mosaics and interactions. These defining characteristics have been altered by three external drivers that create stressors on the system: water management, land-use management and development, and climate change and sea-level rise. Stressors on the South Florida ecosystem include loss of spatial extent; loss of connectivity; altered geomorphology and topography; altered volume, timing, and distribution of regional hydropatterns; input of nutrients; altered fire patterns; and introduction and spread of exotic plants and animals. The Total System Conceptual Ecological Model links stressors to changes in the defining characteristics through major working hypotheses of cause-and-effect relationships. The linkages (ecological effects) relate to hydroperiod and depth patterns, sheet flow, salinity gradients, nutrient status and dynamics, fire patterns, habitat availability, and marsh aquatic fauna prey bases. For each defining characteristic, key ecological indicators are identified to collectively track the decline and restoration of the ecosystem.

WKHs, which were set aside for their rich vascular plant flora, turned out not to be hot spots for the species richness of polypores, nor did their species composition represent the overall species richness of the area. Differences in the total volume of CWD, tree species composition and several CWD qualities were reflected as differences in the species assemblages between the groups. The results indicated that only a fraction of the overall polypore diversity was represented in the small-size WKHs (< 0.5 ha), and the protection of red-listed and indicator polypores in WKHs was random. However, rare old-growth forest indicators were found even in small-size WKHs, if the CWD quality was appropriate for them. Nevertheless, our study does not answer the question whether the occurrences of rare and red-listed species will survive in small-size WKHs surrounded by altered environments such as clear-cuts, because our study sites were located in undisturbed areas. The results stress the importance to protect typical old-growth forest patches with high CWD volume and quality in boreal forests. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Layering single species approaches for monitoring multiple-species conservation plans is inefficient and may lead to management strategies that have unintended detrimental impacts on target and nontarget. organisms. Alternative approaches, such as ecosystem monitoring, can also fail to provide adequate protection for listed species and so may not fulfill regulatory requirements. We propose a hybrid approach that employs Conceptual and spatial data in an iterative process to create niche models for species and species associations within natural Communities. Niche models are composed of testable hypotheses linking species Occurrences to environmental parameters over multiple scales. During an initial data gathering period these hypotheses are evaluated, accepted or rejected, and modified as indicated by new data. Once niche models are corroborated, the focus of monitoring Shifts to a greater emphasis on identified anthropogenic and natural environmental drivers Of Species Occurrence and abundance. The focus on environmental drivers supplies managers with direct information as to how, when, and where to employ adaptive management strategies when natural variance in those drivers is compromised by anthropogenic stressors. We provide a specific example on the conceptualization, development, and implementation Of Our hybrid approach front a new Multiple-species Habitat Conservation Plan for the Coachella Valley, in the Colorado desert Of Southern California.

Given that land management agencies want to prioritize conservation efforts and spend limited resources wisely, we recognized the need to undertake a national gap analysis. We developed the most detailed national vegetation cover map feasible to analyze the degree of representation of ecosystem analysis units (an initial representation of ecosystem types) in the network of conservation lands for the continental United States. We combined The Nature Conservancy's ecoregions with the natural land-cover types of the National Land Cover Data Set and examined the conservation status Of each combination. The majority of ecosystem analysis units have a small percentage of their total area residing in lands that are managed to support biodiversity. The median percentage of area conserved on status I and 2 lands (highest of four levels of protection) as designated by the Gap Analysis Program for the 554 ecosystem analysis units is 4.0% (SD 18.1%). This finding, which highlights our national conservation deficits, points to the need to address the size and diversity of the conservation estate.

J	Stevens, RD				Stevens, RD			Functional morphology meets macroecology: size and shape distributions of New World bats	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH			English	Article						body-size distribution; functional morphology; morphometrics; principal components analysis; shape distribution; size-shape decomposition	BODY-SIZE; EVOLUTION; MICROCHIROPTERA; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; COMMUNITIES; MAMMALS; SPACE	Questions: What is the distribution of sizes of bats when estimated from multivariate analyses conducted on a number of morphological characteristics? Can shapes generated from such analyses inform our understanding of macroecology, in particular how phenotypic characteristics in general vary in nature? Do species-rich functional groups of bats exhibit similar size and shape distributions? Quantitative methods: Principal components analysis imposed on seven morphometric characteristics. Kolmogorov-Smirnov and bootstrap analyses to determine differences among phenotypic distributions. Organisms: New World bats. Conclusions: All distributions were modal, skewed and deviated significantly from the log-normal. Significant differences regarding central tendency of functional groups existed on all phenotypic axes. Functional groups exhibited similar size distributions based on skew and kurtosis, but significantly differed on the log-mass and shape axes. Although similarities in the unimodal and skewed nature of phenotypic distributions suggest universal properties governing the diversification of organisms through space and time, quantitative differences among distributions highlight unique aspects of the evolution of particular phenotypic attributes.

J	Wilcove, DS; Master, LL				Wilcove, DS; Master, LL			How many endangered species are there in the United States?	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							CONSERVATION STRATEGIES; INDICATOR GROUPS; TROPICAL FOREST; BIODIVERSITY; THREATS	Only about 15% of the known species in the United States have been studied in sufficient detail to determine whether or not they are imperiled. Any estimate of the total number of imperiled species in this country must therefore rely on extrapolations from this small number of comparatively well-studied species to a much larger number of poorly studied ones. We review the best available data on the status of plants, animals, and fungi in the US and conclude that the actual number of known species threatened with extinction is at least ten times greater than the number protected under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The key to developing a more accurate picture of the extent of species endangerment is to obtain more data on the following groups (in decreasing order of priority): (1) invertebrate animals; (2) fungi; and (3) marine organisms. However, given the slow pace at which species are being protected under the ESA, and the rapid rate at which natural areas are being destroyed, a more urgent task is to develop and refine approaches to conservation that complement species-by-species protection, most notably the use of coarse filters.

PALEOBIOLOGY			English	Article							DEATH ASSEMBLAGES; BODY-SIZE; PATTERNS; ENVIRONMENTS; BIODIVERSITY; DISSOLUTION; DIVERSITY; BIAS; PALEOECOLOGY; DESTRUCTION	This paper tests whether the most common fossil brachiopod, gastropod, and bivalve genera also have intrinsically more durable shells. Commonness was quantified using occurrence frequency of the 450 most frequently occurring genera of these groups in the Paleobiology Database (PBDB). Durability was scored for each taxon on the basis of shell size, thickness, reinforcement (ribs, folds, spines), mineralogy, and microstructural organic content. Contrary to taphonomic expectation, common genera in the PBDB are as likely to be small, thin-shelled, and unreinforced as large, thick-shelled, ribbed, folded, or spiny. In fact, only six of the 30 tests we performed showed a statistically significant relationship between durability and occurrence frequency, and these six tests were equally divided in supporting or contradicting the taphonomic expectation. Thus, for the most commonly occurring genera in these three important groups, taphonomic effects are either neutral with respect to durability or compensated for by other factors (e.g., less durable taxa were more common in the original communities). These results suggest that biological information is retained in the occurrence frequency patterns of our target groups.

We studied human - elephant conflict in two areas with contrasting scenarios of landuse and conflict, Kahalle and Yala. Kahalle was developed and settled under the Mahaweli irrigation project and the main agricultural practice was irrigated agriculture, with two annual growing seasons. The area was a mosaic of settlements, agriculture, and small forest patches with ill defined human- and elephant- use areas. Elephants ranged within the habitat mosaic year round, occupying remnant forest patches and raiding adjacent crops at night. In contrast, Yala was dominated by a large protected area complex, and the main agricultural methods were slash- and-burn agriculture and rain- fed paddy cultivation. Human- and elephant- use areas were well defined and segregated. The protected area provided elephants with a refuge and food during the rainy season, when the single annual crop was grown. During the dry season, elephants moved into slash-and-burn areas and utilized leftover crops and pioneer vegetation in fallow fields. The landuse pattern and agricultural practices in Yala facilitated co- existence, whereas that in Kahalle led to year round conflict. We suggest that areas managed according to traditional landuse practices should be part of an elephant conservation strategy, where people and elephants have to share resources.

The diet was assessed during the breeding season on the base of pellets and regurgitated food. Pellets from all studied colonies consisted mainly of mammal hair ( almost 100% of samples), bone remains ( 20 - 24%) and invertebrate remains ( 26 - 51%, mainly water beetle, Dytiscus marginalis). Bones and hair of water vole (Arvicola terrestris) and Microtus voles were the most common remains of mammals recorded in pellets. Remains of other animal taxa were found sporadically. In the colonies at Mosty and Kiersity, fish composed more than 95% of collected regurgitated prey items. Food consumption of herons from the biggest colony at Ka. ty Rybackie was estimated to exceed 100 t per season. Herons from Mosty consumed ca 46 - 52 t, from Kiersity 30 - 38 t of food per season. The impact of herons on fish communities was much lower than other losses due to predation ( herons from Ka. ty Rybackie caught only 6% of fishermen bycatch, birds from Mosty took 10 - 14% of round gobies eaten by cormorants).

We conducted a gap analysis of the current reserve network, to evaluate representation by ecosite, and tested two approaches to identify potential additional reserves to increase to target areas of 6%, 7%, 10% and 15%: (1) selecting areas with maximum diversity of forest species composition, soil types, and elevation classes ('heterogeneity method', to incorporate the greatest amount of forest features in the smallest area); and (2) selecting areas to cover a total of 10% of the landbase, with 10% coverage of each ecosite area, if possible ('representation method'). With a 10% target, the heterogeneity and representation methods resulted in 29 and 42 reserves, ranging from 490-2000 to 50-1500 ha, respectively. The heterogeneity method resulted in 13 fewer reserves, 10% more core area, 30% larger mean patch size, and 30% less edge. Representation of ecosites ranged from 0.9% to 23.3% in the current reserve network, 6.7-26.5% for the heterogeneity method, and 8.0-26.4% for the representation method. In simulations of management scenarios with 39-64% plantations and 10% unharvested reserves, projected softwood harvest was similar with both methods, at 2.3-2.5 million m(3) per 5-year period, while hardwood harvest was 0.02-0.09 million m(3) higher, at 0.79-0.82 million m(3) per 5-year period, with the representation than the heterogeneity method. Projected areas of old hardwood, softwood, and mixedwood habitats, defined based upon stand structure characteristics, were similar between the two methods, with up to 1000 ha more with the representation method in some projection periods. We conclude that the heterogeneity method was more effective in that it selected fewer reserves, with larger areas, more core area, and less edge. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cladocerans were confined mostly to lentic areas and abundance between April and September was highest in September, largely a consequence of a floodplain that developed near the mouth. Species richness was related directly to cladoceran abundance. Cladocerans were dominated numerically by three species, Ceriodaphnia cornuta, Diaphanosoma excisum, and D. sarsi. Most species were accommodated within four assemblages. Conductivity, water velocity, pH and temperature were important to species distribution, particularly velocity and conductivity. The most common assemblage was also the most speciose and occurred in moderate total abundance. The second assemblage was also speciose but low in total abundance. Species abundance in groups 1 and 2 tended to be positively related to conductivity and negatively, but weakly, related to pH and temperature. The third assemblage consisted of a single species and occurred in water of low conductivity while the fourth assemblage contained few species and low in overall abundance.

The seed source for CRP grasslands in Ohio often comes from as far away as Missouri or Texas, which may be undesirable from the standpoint of conservation genetics. The goal of this study was to examine the potential for gene flow from large, recently introduced populations of Big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii, Poaceae) to small local populations of this outcrossing perennial species. We examined the potential for cross-pollination between three local populations and three introduced CRP populations by comparing flowering phenologies. Flowering times overlapped extensively, indicating that cross-pollination is possible where local and introduced genotypes co-occur. To compare genetic variation in local and CRP populations, we analyzed variation at 68 RAPD loci in six populations of each type. Somewhat surprisingly, we found no significant differences in the genetic diversity or composition between the two groups (local vs. CRP). In summary, we found that local and introduced populations of Big bluestem have the potential to interbreed, based on their flowering periods, but further research is needed to determine whether local genotypes harbor unique genetic variation that could be jeopardized by hybridization with introduced genotypes.

Here we provide evidence for a general species-time-area relationship (STAR), in which species number is a function of the area and time span of sampling, as well as their interaction. For eight assemblages, ranging from lake zooplankton to desert rodents, this model outperformed a sampling-based model and two simpler models in which area and time had independent effects. In every case, the interaction, on term was negative, meaning that rates of species accumulation in space decreased with the time span of sampling, while species accumulation rates in time decreased with area sampled. Although questions remain about its precise functional form, the STAR provides a tool for scaling species richness across time and space, for comparing the relative rates of species turnover in space and time at different scales of sampling, and for rigorous testing of mechanisms proposed to drive community dynamics. Our results show that the SAR and STR are not separate relationships but two dimensions of one unified pattern.

Obtaining reliable distributional data for indicator species (and therefore reliable estimates of species richness) often requires longitudinal data, that is, surveys for indicator species repeated for several years or time steps. Maximum information must be extracted from such data. We used genetic algorithms and a Bayesian approach to compare the influence of presence/absence data and reporting rate data (the proportion of survey years in which a species was present) on models of species richness based on indicator species. Using data on birds and butterflies from the Great Basin (Nevada, USA), we evaluated models of species richness for one taxonomic group based on indicator species drawn from the same taxonomic group and from a different group. We also evaluated models of combined species richness of both taxonomic groups based on indicator species drawn from either group. We identified suites of species whose occurrence patterns explained as much as 70% of deviance in species richness of a different taxonomic group. Validation tests revealed strong correlations between observed and predicted species richness, with 83-100% of the observed values falling within the 95% credible intervals of the predictions. Whether reporting rate data improved the explanatory and predictive ability of cross-taxonomic models depended on the taxonomic group of the indicator species. The discrepancy in predictive ability was smaller for same-taxon models. Our methods provide a manager with the means to maximize the information obtained from longitudinal survey data.

We investigated the effects of changes in taxonomic resolution on analyses of patterns of multivariate variation at different spatial scales for the highly diverse fauna inhabiting holdfasts of the kelp Ecklonia radiata. 2. Multivariate analyses were performed using several transformations to examine differences in spatial patterns of variation from metres up to hundreds of kilometres for composition vs. relative abundance in assemblages. 3. The greatest variability in assemblages occurred at the smallest spatial scale, from plant to plant, pointing to the existence of important small-scale processes. The proportional amount of variation at the smallest spatial scale decreased with decreasing taxonomic resolution (i.e. from species through to phyla). For composition, the next-greatest source of variation was at the largest spatial scale (hundreds of kilometres), while for relative abundance, the next-greatest source of variation was at the level of sites (hundreds of metres to kilometres). 4 For abundance data, location-level variation became less important and site-level variation became more important with decreasing taxonomic resolution, while for compositional data, the opposite pattern occurred. This suggests that variation in the presence of species or taxa at a particular location along the coast is driven by large-scale processes, while variation in relative abundances within locations is driven by medium-scale processes. 5. The lack of significant variation in the proportional abundances of phyla at large spatial scales suggests that some consistency of pattern may emerge at larger scales (spatial and/or taxonomic), even in the presence of high small-scale variability. These findings strengthen the idea that substantial local variation need not preclude the existence of broad-scale organization in ecological patterns and biodiversity.

A strip transect from dune line to the shore improved an already successful design for monitoring raccoons, and was also sensitive for armadillos. The data were integrated into predator management operations to effectively and efficiently remove the species responsible for turtle nest predation. Tracking plot data also served to validate predator patterns of behavior relative to turtle nesting and improve prospects for preventive predator management strategies. Perhaps the most important finding is that predation at a beach historically suffering nearly complete losses (95%) of marine turtle nests had nest predation reduced to nominal levels (9.4%). For 2002 this predation level represents an estimated 69,000 additional hatchling turtles produced over historical predation rates, and 16,700 additional hatchlings over the previous lowest predation rate.

In outdoor mesocosm experiments, we tested the effects of decreasing shelter availability due to autumn lake-level decrease on the behavior and the growth of two littoral benthic dwellers, the juvenile burbot and the stone loach. The two species showed significantly different changes in behavior when shelter availability decreased. Burbot built up a distinct hierarchy when shelter became sparse, with larger fish being significantly more successful in competing for suitable shelter than smaller conspecifics. The hierarchy, however, ceased when shelter availability decreased below a certain level. The largest fish then increasingly abandoned shelter use, while smaller fish persisted with their sheltering behavior. Stone loach, in contrast, showed no hierarchical order or size-related shelter use. Only burbot showed a significant relationship between the ability to occupy the preferred shelter and the somatic growth. These two species provide an example of different strategies to deal with environmental perturbations like lake-level decrease, with the stenoecious, dominant strategy of the burbot and the euryoccious, evasive strategy of stone loach. The results demonstrate the importance of conducting behavioral studies under as natural conditions as possible.

J	La Sorte, FA; Boecklen, WJ				La Sorte, FA; Boecklen, WJ			Changes in the diversity structure of avian assemblages in North America	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						anthropogenic activity; avian diversity; biological diversity; evenness; homogenization; North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS); similarity; species richness; taxonomic distinctness	BREEDING BIRD SURVEY; SPECIES RICHNESS; ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES; TAXONOMIC DISTINCTNESS; BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY; POPULATION-CHANGE; EXTINCTION DEBT; BIODIVERSITY; URBANIZATION; HABITAT	Aim To determine the major patterns of change in avian diversity structure over space and time at a local resolution and continental extent in non-urban areas in North America. Location The contiguous United States and southern Canada. Methods We used 1673 North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes containing 547 terrestrial and aquatic species to estimate four diversity components: species richness, individual abundance, taxonomic distinctness and species evenness. We implemented three levels of analysis to examine changes in diversity structure on a yearly basis from 1968 to 2003: (1) a canonical analysis of discriminance, (2) a univariate analysis across BBS routes, and (3) a univariate analysis at individual BBS routes. We estimated changes in similarity in species composition over time between 470,730 BBS route pairs. We also estimated the level of human activity at BBS routes using three spatial anthropogenic databases. Results BBS routes were located in non-urban areas in association with low nighttime light activity and moderately low human population densities. The analysis of diversity structure indicated the presence of two independent patterns: (1) a temporally consistent pattern defined by increasing species richness (12% increase from 1968 to 2003) associated with limited gains in taxonomic distinctness, and (2) an association between species abundance and evenness related to variability in abundance associated with the most abundant species. The similarity analysis indicated that BBS routes located closer to the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts of the United States experienced the strongest patterns of homogenization of species composition. Main conclusions Our results suggest that avian diversity structure has changed at the local scale in non-urban areas in North America. However, there was no evidence for a consistent continent-wide pattern. Instead, the evidence pointed to the presence of regional factors influencing diversity patterns. This study provides a foundation for more detailed investigations of the spatiotemporal and taxonomic details of these general patterns.

To account for the variability in forest structure among fragments, we described and minimized the influence of foliage density and stratification on small mammal data. Sites were distributed among three categories of fragment size and in continuous forest. For small and medium-sized categories, we considered isolated fragments and fragments connected by corridors to larger remnants. Small mammal abundance and alpha and beta diversity were regressed against site scores from the first axis of a Principal Component Analysis on forest structure variables. Residuals were used in analyses of variance to compare fragment size and connectivity categories. Forest structure influenced total abundance and abundance of some species individually, but not the diversity of small mammal communities. Total abundance and alpha diversity were lower in small and medium-sized fragments than in large fragments and continuous forest, and in isolated compared to connected fragments. Three species were less common, but none was more abundant in smaller fragments. At least one species was more abundant in connected compared to isolated fragments. Beta diversity showed an opposite relationship to fragment size and corridors, increasing in small and isolated fragments. Results highlight the importance of secondary forest for the conservation of tropical fauna, the hyper-dynamism of small isolated fragments and the potential of corridors to buffer habitat fragmentation effects in tropical landscapes.

J	Power, M; O'Connell, MF; Dempson, JB				Power, M; O'Connell, MF; Dempson, JB			Ecological segregation within and among Arctic char morphotypesin Gander Lake, Newfoundland	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES			English	Article						Salvelinus alpinus; stable isotope analysis; polymorphism; ecological segregation; Gander Lake; Newfoundland; competition	SALVELINUS-ALPINUS L.; STABLE-ISOTOPE ANALYSIS; TROPHIC POLYMORPHISM; ATLANTIC SALMON; LOCH RANNOCH; BROOK CHARR; SIZE; SCOTLAND; POPULATION; NITROGEN	Stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen were used to examine differences in the feeding ecology of sympatric morphotypes of Arctic char, Salvelinus alpinus, from Gander Lake, Newfoundland. Morphotypes were differentiated on the basis of colour (pale and dark) and meristic characteristics. Significant differences in length, age and habitat depth were also noted, with the pale-form being smaller, younger and caught at greater average depths than the dark-form. Pale and dark morphotypes possessed significantly different carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures, with the dark-form being more delta(13)C enriched than the pale-form. Within each morphotype grouping distinctive isotopic signature differences related to diet (dark-form) and capture depth (pale-form) were also observed. Differences in the isotopic signatures within and among habitat groupings were induced by differences in feeding opportunities arising from differences in habitat use and feeding strategies and generally corroborated by stomach content analysis and an index of dietary overlap. Study results provide evidence for the contention that sympatric forms of Arctic char in Gander Lake occupy significantly different foraging niches within the lake. Results further suggest ecologically relevant separations within morphotype groupings result in lower resource competition.

Manipulative experiments typically support this hypothesis but have focused mainly on one trophic level (i.e., primary producers). To date, we know little about how positive interactions among species may influence the relationship between diversity and invasibility, which suggests a need for research that addresses the question: under what conditions does diversity affect resistance to invasion? We used experimental manipulations of both plant diversity and the presence of an endophytic fungus to test whether a fungal mutualist of an invasive grass species (Lolium arundinaceum) switches the relationship between plant community diversity and resistance to invasion. Association with the fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum) increased the ability of L. arundinaceum to invade communities with greater species diversity. In the absence of the endophyte, the initial diversity of the community significantly reduced the establishment of L. arundinaceum. However, establishment was independent of initial diversity in the presence of the endophyte. Fungal symbionts, like other key species, are often overlooked in studies of plant diversity, yet their presence may explain variation among studies in the effect of diversity on resistance to invasion.

"Emergy" created by H.T. Odum is a new method for evaluating natural capital and ecosystem services. The "ecological footprint" created by Wackernagel and Rees has been promoted as a policy and planning tool for sustainability. The aim of this paper is to show a modified form of ecological footprint calculation by combining emergy analysis with conventional ecological footprint form of calculations. Our new method starts from the energy flows of a system in calculating ecological footprint and carrying capacity. Through a study of the energy flows, and using the method of emergy analysis, the energy flows of a system are translated into corresponding biological productive units. To demonstrate the mechanics of this new method, we compared our calculations with that of an original calculation of ecological footprint of a regional case. We select Gansu province in western China, as an example for application of our study. In this case the same conclusions were drawn using both methods: that Gansu province runs an ecological deficit.

J	Bond, JM; Daniels, R; Bioret, F				Bond, JM; Daniels, R; Bioret, F			Genetic diversity in Crambe maritima along the English Channel: the role of ocean currents in determining population structure	ECOGRAPHY			English	Article							DISTANCE SEED DISPERSAL; MICROSATELLITE ANALYSIS; CONSERVATION GENETICS; PLANT CONSERVATION; CONSEQUENCES; WIND; SIZE; COLONIZATION; BORAGINACEAE; ALLOCATION	We utilised genetic markers (ISSR's) to investigate population structuring in Crambe maritima, a coastal perennial found in isolated populations on either side of the English Channel. Despite the expectation that smaller populations would contain lower levels of genetic diversity, we found no correlation with total population size or the number of flowering plants and genetic diversity. Although populations were genetically differentiated from each other, isolation by distance was not apparent in the whole data set or within the UK samples. Despite being sampled from a wide geographic range, the majority of diversity (71%) was contained within populations, with no unique genotype, or even allele, identifying any population. When genetic distances were plotted using MDS techniques, samples from each population had a tendency to cluster, but the spread of points was wide indicating high levels of gene flow. High levels of gene flow, through the dispersal of seeds, were verified by assignment testing, which showed that 8.7% of individuals were assigned to a population other than the one they were collected from. The pattern of genetic variation can be explained by examining the direction of currents in the English Channel and Bay of Biscay. Gene flow, via seed dispersal, is possible between UK and French populations on either side of the English Channel. In contrast, French populations on the Bay of Biscay coast are effectively isolated by the direction of currents and consequently show a greater degree of genetic differentiation.

J	Peres, CA				Peres, CA			Why we need megareserves in Amazonia	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article							BRAZILIAN AMAZONIA; TROPICAL FORESTS; CONSERVATION; FIRE; BIODIVERSITY; RESERVES; DENSITY; PARKS	Brazilian Amazonia faces one of the greatest threats and opportunities for tropical biodiversity conservation of our times. I consider several large-scale issues in biodiversity conservation planning (e.g., resource extraction, large areas needed for top predators, species migration, fire, and carbon sequestration) in light of our severely deficient understanding of basinwide patterns of species distribution and little-known Amazonian biota. The long-term persistence of this biota is best served by strictly protected and sustainable development forest reserves that are both embedded in a benign forest matrix and sufficiently large to support a full complement of species and landscape-scale ecological processes. Given rapidly accelerating trends in agricultural frontier expansion into previously unclaimed public lands, protection and controlled development of forests is urgent.

J	Dixon, PM; Ellison, AM; Gotelli, NJ				Dixon, PM; Ellison, AM; Gotelli, NJ			Improving the precision of estimates of the frequency of rare events	ECOLOGY			English	Article						aggregation; Balyesian inference; coefficient of variation; estimators; precision; rare events; regression; sampling; stratification	BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; CARNIVOROUS PLANT; ECOLOGY; SARRACENIA	The probability of a rare event is usually estimated directly as the number of times the event occurs divided by the total sample size. Unfortunately, the precision of this estimate is low. For typical sample sizes of N < 100 in ecological studies, the coefficient of variation (cv) of this estimate of the probability of a rare event can exceed 300%. Sample sizes on the order of 10(3)-10(4) observations are needed to reduce the cv to below 10%. If it is impractical or impossible to increase the sample size, auxiliary data can be used to improve the precision of the estimate. We describe four approaches for using auxiliary data to improve the precision of estimates of the probability of a rare event: (1) Bayesian analysis that includes prior information about the probability; (2) stratification that incorporates information on the heterogeneity in the population; (3) regression models that account for information correlated with the probability; and (4) inclusion of aggregated data collected at larger spatial or temporal scales. These approaches are illustrated using data on the probability of capture of vespulid wasps by the insectivorous plant Darlingtonia californica. All four methods increase the precision of the estimate relative to the simple frequency-based estimate (absolute precision = 1.26, relative precision [cv] = 70%): stratification (absolute precision = 1.10, cv = 62%); regression models (absolute precision = 1.59, cv = 55%); Bayesian analysis with an informative prior probability distribution (absolute precision = 4.28, cv = 47%); and using temporally aggregated data (absolute precision 6.75, cv = 36%). When informative auxiliary data is available, we recommend including it when estimating the probability of rare events.

Three serial surveys of Brisbane residents provide data on the knowledge of respondents about the mahogany glider. The results supply information about the attitudes of respondents to the mahogany glider, to its conservation and relevant public policies, and about variations in these factors as the knowledge of participants of the mahogany glider alters. Similarly, data are provided and analysed about the willingness to pay of respondents to conserve the mahogany glider and how it changes. Population viability analysis is applied to estimate the required habitat area for a minimum viable population of the mahogany glider to ensure at least a 95% probability of its survival for 100 years. Places are identified in Queensland where the requisite minimum area of critical habitat can be conserved. Using the survey results as a basis, the likely willingness of groups of Australians to pay for the conservation of the mahogany glider is estimated and consequently their willingness to pay for the minimum required area of its habitat. Methods for estimating the cost of protecting this habitat are outlined. Australia-wide benefits are estimated to exceed the costs. Establishing a national park containing the minimum viable population of the mahogany glider is an appealing management option. This would also be beneficial in conserving other endangered wildlife species and ecosystems. Therefore, additional economic benefits to those estimated on account of the mahogany glider itself can be obtained. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A total of 15 anuran species belonging to three families were detected in the two crops. The numbers of individuals found in soybean and the variety of arthropods they consumed suggest that anuran populations could be important biological control factors of soybean arthropods.

Spatial scales ranged between 10(0-1) and 10(3) m and samples were collected at three times within I year. Variability in diversity of assemblages, as well as abundances of the 15 most common taxa, were estimated and tested using ANOVA. Nonparametric multivariate analyses of variance (NP-MANOVA) were used to test and estimate the variability of whole assemblages. Univariate analyses revealed that all variables showed significant spatial and temporal patterns but that these differed among individual taxa. A general finding was that there was much interactive variability between times of sampling and the two spatial scales tested. This means that abundance and diversity of infauma changed differently among bays located a few kilometers apart and among locations within bays located hundreds of meters apart. Thus, spatial patterns of assemblages changed among times of sampling. Conclusions were similar for univariate as well as multivariate analyses, although multivariate patterns appeared slightly more persistent. Furthermore, estimation of variance components showed a substantial variability among cores within locations. The results provide the first coherent analysis of interactive scale-dependent variability in these geographic areas and one of few in soft sediments. Results are discussed in relation to previously observed patterns of spatio-temporal variability in soft sediments and in a context of potential processes responsible for creating patterns at particular spatial scales. Results were also used for cost benefit analyses in order to compare precision of optimal solutions to what was observed and to optimise future sampling of these assemblages. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Seven kit foxes and 16 red foxes were radio-collared and tracked via radiotelemetry near Lost Hills, California. One kit fox was killed by a red fox. Home ranges of the 2 species did not overlap extensively Although both species used similar habitats, they used different parcels of land. Kit foxes and red foxes primarily consurned rodents on the study site, and dietary overlap was considerable. Red foxes also may have been using dens formerly used by kit foxes. Thus, red foxes were engaging in both interference and exploitative competition with kit foxes, and red foxes constitute a potentially significant threat to kit foxes. Coyotes (Canis latrans) co-occur with kit foxes and may limit red fox abundance and distribution.

An interdisciplinary, map-based process was used to synthesize information, and the fields of regional ecology and ecosystem geography provided the foundation for analysis. Results illustrate that the protected areas share several regional-scale ecosystem components with each other and with surrounding areas, including globally significant populations of large mammals and other wildlife species as well as vegetation communities that experience a full suite of natural disturbances with little human intervention. The valleys of the Tatshenshini, Alsek, and Copper Rivers serve as important links between coastal and interior areas as well as conduits for the movement of biota. However, connectivity is not distributed equally across the region, and the four core national parks have. linkages with adjacent areas that are as strong, and in many cases stronger, than among themselves. The management challenge is not a matter of linking separate protected areas to create networks. Instead, it lies in integrating existing protected areas with each other and with surrounding areas and resisting small changes that have incremental and cumulative impacts. Interagency cooperation is seen as a key component in facilitating this, and some success has been achieved on the scale of single issues and specific resources. The challenge ahead is to build on this success by strengthening existing institutional frameworks and working toward more comprehensive efforts. Similar lessons can be derived for other complex mountain landscapes and northern regions where large protected areas and multiple land management agencies exist.

J	Hietz, P				Hietz, P			Conservation of vascular epiphyte diversity in Mexican coffee plantations	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						coffee culture; shade tree; species richness estimate; vegetation analysis	TROPICAL AGROECOSYSTEM; CENTRAL VERACRUZ; BIODIVERSITY; CHIAPAS; FOREST; TRANSFORMATION; BROMELIADS; ECOLOGY; SYSTEMS; TREES	Coffee plantations have replaced many lower-montane forests in the Neotropics, and ongoing intensification is converting traditional polycultures with a variety of shade trees to plantations with no or monospecific shade trees. To evaluate the impact of coffee cultivation on epiphyte diversity, I surveyed vascular epiphytes on shade trees in nine different coffee plantations and compared records with those in four natural forests in central Veracruz, Mexico. Eighty-nine species occurred in coffee plantations, and 104 species occurred in natural forests. The number of epiphytic species in traditional polycultures with old shade trees, mostly of the genus Inga, was similar to that in forests, but plantations with small trees and sparse shade hosted fewer epiphytes than those with large trees. Epiphyte communities were, however, more homogeneous in coffee plantations than in forests, possibly because of a drier microclimate and the lack of large and long-lived trees. These results demonstrate the value of traditional polycultures for epiphyte diversity, show the importance of conserving large shade trees, and suggest that these coffee systems may not be suitable for all epiphytes.

J	Pickett, STA; Cadenasso, ML; Grove, JM				Pickett, STA; Cadenasso, ML; Grove, JM			Biocomplexity in coupled natural-human systems: A multidimensional framework	ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						biocomplexity; biodiversity; heterogeneity; history; cross-disciplinary; integration; space; time; organization; metaphor	HETEROGENEITY; BOUNDARIES; COMPLEXITY; SCIENCE; FUTURE	As defined by Ascher, biocomplexity results from a "multiplicity" of interconnected relationships and levels." However, no integrative framework yet exists to facilitate the application of this concept to coupled human-natural systems. Indeed, the term "biocomplexity" is still used primarily as a creative and provocative metaphor. To help advance its utility, we present a framework that focuses on linkages among different disciplines that are often used in studies of coupled human-natural systems, including the ecological, physical, and socioeconomic sciences. The framework consists of three dimensions of complexity: spatial, organizational, and temporal. Spatial complexity increases as the focus changes from the type and number of the elements of spatial heterogeneity to an explicit configuration of the elements. Similarly, organizational complexity increases as the focus shifts from unconnected units to connectivity among functional units. Finally, temporal complexity increases as the current state of a system comes to rely more and more on past states, and therefore to reflect echoes, legacies, and evolving indirect effects of those states. This three-dimensional, conceptual volume of biocomplexity enables connections between models that derive from different disciplines to be drawn at an appropriate level of complexity for integration.

J	Marulli, J; Mallarach, JM				Marulli, J; Mallarach, JM			A GIS methodology for assessing ecological connectivity: application to the Barcelona Metropolitan Area	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article						Barcelona; GIS; metropolitan area; ecological connectivity; regional planning	LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE; HABITAT; CONSERVATION; SYSTEM; FRAGMENTATION; POPULATIONS; CORRIDORS; ROADS	We developed a new methodology for the assessment of landscape and ecological connectivity at regional scale. This method has been entirely formalized using mathematical language, is supported by a topological analysis of a 1:25,000 scale land use map, and has been developed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The method allows the elaboration of a diagnose of the connectivity of terrestrial landscape ecosystems, on the basis of a previously defined set of ecological functional areas, and a computational cost-distance model which includes the barrier effect. This last component takes into consideration the type of barrier, the distance impact, and the adjacent land use and vegetation type. We defined two new compound indices: one for ecological connectivity and another for the barrier effect. The practical interest of our model is that it not only allows a cost-effective assessment of the current situation, but it has predictive capabilities, allowing the quantitative assessment and comparison of the impacts resulting from different planning scenarios or different infrastructure alternatives on the landscape and ecological connectivity. The application of this model to the Barcelona Metropolitan Area (BMA), 16% of which is currently classified as urban, showed that 65% of the BMA area is currently occupied by functional ecological areas, and that 18% is covered by artificial barriers, although they have a direct negative impact on 56.5% of the area. The model also allowed the identification of vulnerable spots, including 1.7% of the BMA that has a critical importance for ecological connectivity, as well as the network of landscape linkages and ecological corridors that offer a high restoration potential. Further applications of this methodology assessing the impacts of regional and urban plans on ecological connectivity, suggest than it could easily be extrapolated to other regions.

Species present in any particular biological assemblage tend also to be present in larger assemblages. The same is true for the so called species-range size distribution: locally abundant species tend to be widespread, whereas locally rare species tend to be narrowly distributed. According to several ecologists, this pattern could be described by a power law. In this paper we show that regularities tested with our data (soil types = pedotaxa, and soilscapes = pedological assemblages) are surprisingly similar to those in ecological literature. For this purpose several soil data sets, as well as techniques utilised in mathematical ecology, including Atmar and Patterson's Nested Calculator Program have been used. Many of these common patterns appear at different spatial scales suggesting that mechanisms such as nestedness, taxa-range size distributions and species-area relationships among others could be scale invariant, as some ecologists claim. Our results show that nestedness and scale-independent taxa-range size distributions are not exclusive properties of biological assemblages, but can be found in a broader class of earth systems. Pedodiversity analysis also has practical implications for designing reserves for biological and pedological conservation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Notably, the evolutionary consequences of migration between breeding and nonbreeding areas have received limited attention. We provide evidence for a negative association between interpopulation differences in migration (between breeding and feeding areas, as well as within each) and the amount of gene flow (m) among three brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) populations inhabiting Mistassini Lake, Quebec, Canada. Individuals (n = 1166) captured throughout lake feeding areas over two consecutive sampling years were genotyped (10 microsatellites) and assigned to one of the three populations. Interpopulation differences in migration were compared based on spatial distribution overlap, habitat selection, migration distance within feeding areas, and morphology. We observed a temporally stable, heterogeneous spatial distribution within feeding areas among populations, with the extent of spatial segregation related to differential habitat selection (represented by littoral zone substrate). Spatial segregation was lowest and gene flow highest (in = 0.015) between two populations breeding in separate lake inflows. Segregation was highest and gene flow was lowest (mean m = 0.007) between inflow populations and a third population breeding in the outflow. Compared to outflow migrants, inflow migrants showed longer migration distances within feeding areas (64-70 km vs. 22 km). After entering natal rivers to breed, inflow migrants also migrated longer distances (35-75 km) and at greater elevations (50-150 m) to breeding areas than outflow migrants (0-15 km; - 10-0 m). Accordingly, inflow migrants were more streamlined with longer caudal regions, traits known to improve swimming efficiency. There was no association between the geographic distance separating population pairs and the amount of gene flow they exchanged. Collectively, Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that reduced gene flow between these brook charr populations results from divergent natural selection leading to interpopulation differences in migration. They also illustrate how phenotypic and genetic differentiation may arise over complex migratory life cycles.

Walsh functions are a system of orthogonal functions used in showing how the energy in a given signal is distributed among these rectangular wave components revealing the existent boundaries. This paper presents the capacity of Walsh transform on determining the statistical significance of discontinuities within ordered marine ecological data. Marine ecosystems present high vertical patterns; dataseries on particulate matter concentrations (measured by the Underwater Video Profiler (UVP)) were used to recognize homogeneity limits in water columns. Firstly, Walsh functions are generated in a compact form. Then, a spectral decomposition is performed on the ecological signal to obtain a stepped Walsh version; the step width at this stage is unvarying, picking constant vertical sections. To avoid this limitation, the estimated series is then smoothed to recognize changing step widths by merging successive blocks presenting statistical non-significant difference; here the nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is used. This Walsh transform algorithm provides a fast, simple yet accurate means of separating ordered ecological data into groups of observations corresponding to different marine water masses. This method is applied to four profiles measured at the same site during 2 days. The temporal evolution of depth transitions are first discussed and then used for the validation of the transform model. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The aim of the study was to examine the methanogen populations in a drained bog in northern Finland, and to assess the possible effect of ash fertilization on potential methane production and methanogen communities. Peat samples were collected from control and ash fertilized (15,000 kg/ha) plots 5 years after ash application, and potential CH4 production was measured. The methanogen community structure was studied by DNA isolation, PCR amplification of the methyl coenzyme-M reductase (mcr) gene, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The drained peatland showed low potential methane production and methanogen diversity in both control and ash-fertilized plots. Samples from both upper and deeper layers of peat were dominated by three groups of sequences related to Rice cluster-I hydrogenotroph methanogens. Even though pH was marginally greater in the ash-treated site, the occurrence of those sequences was not affected by ash fertilization.

Historical differences in the partitioning and tenure of land in southwestern North America has resulted in vast differences in parcel sizes. Smaller parcels at the eastern edge (western Oklahoma) of the shortgrass prairie are bounded by far more fence and traversed by far more roads and power lines than are larger parcels at the western edge (eastern New Mexico). The increased extent of fencing. roads and power lines is associated with higher mortality of female, but not male. lesser prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus), a rare species endemic to the south-central United States. Differences in mortality rates appear to have selected for differences in life history strategies: relative to females in New Mexico. female prairie-chickens in Oklahoma lay larger clutches and nest fewer years but make more attempts within a year. The results of this trade-off have left Oklahoma birds far more susceptible to year-to-year environmental perturbations, explaining that population's rapid decline relative to the more stable populations in New Mexico.

Topographic orientation is often used as a proxy for relative radiation load due to its effects on evaporative demand and local temperature. Common methods for incorporating this information (i.e., site measures of slope and aspect) fail to include daily or annual changes in solar orientation and shading effects from local topography. As a result, these static measures do not incorporate the level of spatial and temporal heterogeneity required to examine vegetation patterns at the landscape level. We developed a widely applicable method for estimating potential relative radiation (PRR) using digital elevation data and a widely used geographic information system (Arc/Info). We found significant differences among four increasingly comprehensive radiation proxies. Our GIS-based proxy compared well with estimates from more data-intensive and computationally rigorous radiation models. We note that several recent studies have not found strong correlations between vegetation pattern and landscape-scale differences in radiation. We suggest that these findings may be due to the use of proxies that were not accurately capturing variability in radiation, and we recommend PRR or similar measures for use in future vegetation analyses.

The movement of native herbivores onto agricultural land is a key management issue world-wide as they may compete with domestic livestock for pasture and contribute to overgrazing and soil erosion. Eastern grey kangaroos Macropus giganteus are viewed as a problem species in temperate south-eastern Australia, where high-density populations in reserves encroach on nearby farmland. 2. This study examined home range size and use in M. giganteus across different types of land use and in relation to population density and pasture availability. 3. Farmland adjacent to either radiata pine plantations or reserves supporting high-density populations of M. giganteus was subject to frequent incursions by kangaroos moving onto farmland to rest or graze. However, animals from reserves moved on average only 135 m onto farms. 4. Home ranges of M. giganteus were significantly smaller in the reserves than in farm study sites where population densities were lower. At reserve sites, home range size was limited by higher population densities and limited opportunity for dispersal across surrounding open farmland because of a lack of cover. Home range size was not affected by resource availability. 5. Where suitable vegetation cover occurred on farmland (e.g. woodland remnants or scrub), M. giganteus occurred as resident or roving small mobs. This may be seen by farmers as a disincentive to preserve remnant vegetation as it can provide habitat for unwanted native wildlife. 6. Home range attributes of M. giganteus suggest the species could be controlled by culling. However, recolonization occurs quickly and little is known of dispersal. 7. Synthesisandapplications. Population density, presence of cover and reluctance to disperse across cleared landscapes are key factors influencing kangaroo home range size and use of adjacent farmland. Currently, little incentive exists for farmers to preserve remnant vegetation, as it may be regarded as providing habitat for unwanted or 'pest' kangaroos. Given the potential importance of remnant vegetation on private land for the conservation of plants and other species of wildlife, government incentives and compensation programmes may be required to limit land clearing on farms and to encourage improved pasture management.

J	Coulston, JW; Riitters, KH				Coulston, JW; Riitters, KH			Preserving biodiversity under current and future climates: a case study	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						coarse-filter; conservation; Douglas-fir communities; ecological envelope; factor analysis; global climate change; North America; Pseudotsuga menziesii	TRANSFER SCHEME LSX; UNITED-STATES; BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY; PROTECTED AREAS; MODEL GENESIS; RANGE; CONSERVATION; VEGETATION; FORESTS	Aim The conservation of biological and genetic diversity is a major goal of reserve systems at local, regional, and national levels. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources suggests a 12% threshold (area basis) for adequate protection of biological and genetic diversity of a plant community. However, thresholds based on area may protect only a small portion of the total diversity if the locations are chosen without regard to the variation within the community. The objectives of this study were to demonstrate methods to apply a coarse-filter approach for identifying gaps in the current reserve system of the Psuedotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir) forest type group based on current climatic conditions and a global climate change scenario. Location Western United States. Method We used an ecological envelope approach that was based on seven bioclimatic factors, two topographic factors, and two edaphic factors. Multivariate factor analysis was then used to reduce the envelope to two dimensions. The relative density of habitat and protected areas were identified in each part of the envelope based on the current climate and potential future climate. We used this information to identify gaps in the reserve system. Results Although the protected areas occurred in all parts of the envelope, most existed in colder and drier areas. This was true for both the current climate and potential future climate. Main conclusion To protect more of the ecological envelope, future conservation efforts would be most effective in western Oregon, north-western Washington, and north-western California.

We need to solve several methodological problems concerning the principle of El: briefly, can we label as core areas only zones without human impact under the present conditions of European cultural landscapes? We modified the theoretical global principle of "static integrity" into "dynamic integrity" for the purpose of the detailed counting of landscape structures. We introduced basic socio-economic typology into the Czech landscape. There are the following five landscape types: natural landscape, largely natural landscape, largely rural landscape, largely agricultural landscape, and largely urban and industrial landscape. Statistically, there is an increasing area of the first group of the most natural zones in our country. It means, according to El, an increasing area of core zones. The source for this seems to be decreasing agriculture land area. However, there are also important socio-ecological reasons for the stability of this process.

It is based on examination of the distribution of parental strains and the F-1 and F-2 hybrids in a multidimensional space, and the determination of the directions corresponding to heterozygosity, epistatic and additive gene effects. The effect of heterozygosity includes variability produced by interaction between and within heterozygous loci. The additive gene effects and the remaining epistatic interactions between the homozygous loci can be visualized separately from the effects of heterozygosity by an appropriate projection of the points in multidimensional space. In all, 20 morphological, physiological and behavioural characters and 21 craniometric measures were studied in crosses between two laboratory rat strains. Linear combinations of craniometric and of morphophysiological characters with a high narrow-sense heritability could be identified. These combinations characterized the organismal stress response, which had been selected for in one of the strains. The prospects for the practical application of the new approach and also for the evaluation of the contribution of the genetic diversity to phenotypic variability in animals in natural populations are discussed.

Grazing by goats and sheep is allowed in the Richtersveld National Park (a contractual National Park) which is also an area of high floristic richness and endemism. We used goat faecal pellet density, degree of trampling and percentage bare-ground at distances from the stock posts as surrogates for a gradient in grazing pressure. A stock post is the place where farmers keep, in most cases in an enclosure called a 'kraal', their animals at night and to which they return every evening after the day's herding. Twenty-seven stock posts were located in the Richtersveld National Park; nine stock posts on flats, foot-slopes and mountain each. We measured plant species richness and diversity, and mean percentage cover of the various plant growth forms (including the number of species falling into each growth form category) in each of the five 10 m x 10 m plots (each 200 m apart) demarcated along a transect of one kilometre length from the centre of each stock post. The results showed that distance from the stock post does reflect grazing intensity use because densities in faecal pellets rapidly declined with increasing distances away from the stock post for all habitats studied. Faecal density was positively correlated with stocking density. Plant species richness and diversity was at a minimum near stock posts. Plants able to endure the effects of heavy grazing occurred near stock posts where declines in palatable plant species, assumingly sensitive to heavy grazing and trampling, were recorded. Grazing increased vegetation patchiness up to 800 m from the stock post for all the habitats. The degree to which this change in species composition occurred did not depend on stocking densities, suggesting that both grazing and landscape variability were responsible for vegetation changes in rangelands of that area of the Succulent Karoo biome.

J	MacDougall, AS; Turkington, R				MacDougall, AS; Turkington, R			Are invasive species the drivers or passengers of change in degraded ecosystems?	ECOLOGY			English	Article						British Columbia; Canada; dominance; facilitation; functional redundancy; oak savanna; plant competition; plant invasion; recruitment limitation; removal experiment; repeated-measures ANOVA	COMMUNITY STABILITY; TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; SEED LIMITATION; OAK SAVANNA; GRASSLAND; COMPETITION; DISTURBANCE; DOMINANCE; BIODIVERSITY; RICHNESS	Few invaded ecosystems are free from habitat loss and disturbance, leading to uncertainty whether dominant invasive species are driving community change or are passengers along for the environmental ride. The "driver" model predicts that invaded communities are highly interactive, with subordinate native species being limited or excluded by competition from the exotic dominants. The "passenger" model predicts that invaded communities are primarily structured by noninteractive factors (environmental change, dispersal limitation) that are less constraining on the exotics, which thus dominate. We tested these alternative hypotheses in an invaded, fragmented, and fire-suppressed oak savanna. We examined the impact of two invasive dominant perennial grasses on community structure using a reduction (mowing of aboveground biomass) and removal (weeding of above- and belowground biomass) experiment conducted at different seasons and soil depths. We examined the relative importance of competition vs. dispersal limitation with experimental seed additions. Competition by the dominants limits the abundance and reproduction of many native and exotic species based on their increased performance with removals and mowing. The treatments resulted in increased light availability and bare soil; soil moisture and N were unaffected. Although competition was limiting for some, 36 of 79 species did not respond to the treatments or declined in the absence of grass cover. Seed additions revealed that some subordinates are dispersal limited; competition alone was insufficient to explain their rarity even though it does exacerbate dispersal inefficiencies by lowering reproduction. While the net effects of the dominants were negative, their presence restricted woody plants, facilitated seedling survival with moderate disturbance (i.e., treatments applied in the fall), or was not the primary limiting factor for the occurrence of some species. Finally, the species most functionally distinct from the dominants (forbs, woody plants) responded most significantly to the treatments. This suggests that relative abundance is determined more by trade-offs relating to environmental conditions (long-term fire suppression) than to traits relating to resource capture (which should most impact functionally similar species). This points toward the passenger model as the underlying cause of exotic dominance, although their combined effects (suppressive and facilitative) on community structure are substantial.

J	Toth, LA				Toth, LA			Plant community structure and temporal variability in a channelized subtropical floodplain	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST			English	Article							WEIGHTED AVERAGES; KISSIMMEE RIVER; ECOSYSTEM; RESTORATION; PERSISTENCE; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; WETLANDS; FLORIDA; WATER	Species composition, cover, diversity, and temporal dynamics of the three main plant communities in the channelized Kissimmee River floodplain were evaluated to provide a baseline for tracking the success of an ongoing restoration project. Much of the drained floodplain supports an upland herbaceous community with cover dominated by the planted pasture grasses Paspalum notatum and Axonopus fissifolius. Mesophytic woody communities are comprised primarily of Myrica cerifera, Baccharis halimifolia, Ludwigia peruviana, and understory ferns, while Sagittaria lancifolia, Pontederia cordata, and Panicum hemitomon are dominant species in remnant wetland communities. Community composition and the associated gradient of weighted averages of wetland indicator species reflect prevailing hydroperiods and land uses on the drained floodplain. Managed hydrologic regimes have promoted temporal stability, with seasonal variability of plant community characteristics limited to a decline in live plant cover and species richness during winter months. Lower live vegetation cover during winter resulted from senescence of dominant herbaceous species, while the winter decline in species richness was due primarily to sampling error resulting from seasonal phenology of taxonomic characteristics and obscured growth of rare or diminutive species. The limited variability of plant community characteristics in the channelized floodplain reduces the potential for confounding uncertainty in evaluating successful restoration. Results indicate that functional assessment of plant community characteristics in this subtropical floodplain is most accurately measured in spring and summer.

Population abundance, species composition, and community structure were investigated over the 3-year study period. The soil arthropods consisted of Acari (75.38%), Collembola (16.11%), and others (8.51%), and their abundances showed a clear difference between the rainy and dry seasons. Population abundance of Collembola and Acari were low during drought conditions. The humidity was the most important factor determining, distribution, abundance, and survival of soil Collembola in this tropical forest. High predation and low accumulation of organic matter caused low population abundance of Collembola in the tropical habitat. The collembolan community was dominated by a few dominant species over the study period. The pattern of seasonal changes in numbers of Collembola was similar over the 3-year study period. The species composition of the collembolan community was constant and persistent throughout a 3-year study period.

This work also aimed to test whether the genetic structuring of a group of populations could be predicted from differences in the geomorphologic history of the region they inhabit. Location Eight landlocked populations were sampled from cold-temperate lakes in north-western Patagonia. The study area could be split latitudinally into two sectors that differed in their geomorphology, each of them hosting four populations. The southern sector shows evidence of a higher degree of glacial coverage, and the lakes are probably remnants of a big proglacial palaeolake. Lakes in the northern sector, on the other hand, suggest no common origin. Results Significant genetic structuring was found among the studied populations (Theta = 0.188), being the highest value reported to date for the species. Significant correlation was found between genetic diversity and lake area and perimeter. Diversity also showed a slight latitudinal variation suggesting the presence of genetically distinct groups of populations. The comparison of populations from the two geographical sectors showed that those from the north had a higher diversity, more private alleles and strong structuring, while those from the south were less diverse and much more homogeneous. Main conclusions Non-migratory populations of G. maculatus show much higher values of genetic structuring than those reported for diadromous populations. This follows the pattern seen when comparing migratory and non-migratory species of Galaxias. This agrees with population genetics theory which predicts that restricted gene flow would result in greater among-population divergence. Also, differences between northern and southern populations agreed with what was predicted by the geomorphologic history of the study area. During the Last Glacial Maximum ice cover in that region may have reduced the habitat of G. maculatus to a refuge with an impoverished gene pool. When the ice receded, leaving a great proglacial lake, that former population expanded and became fragmented after water levels descended. This resulted in present day lakes harbouring homogeneous populations with reduced diversity. The northern sector, in contrast, was less affected by glaciers, resulting in more geomorphologically stable lakes holding genetically diverse populations.

J	Anderson, TM; Lachance, MA; Starmer, WT				Anderson, TM; Lachance, MA; Starmer, WT			The relationship of phylogeny to community structure: The cactus yeast community	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						community ecology; assembly rules; phylogenetic distance; species abundance; phylogeny; community structure	SPECIES RICHNESS; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; COMPETITION; ECOLOGY; DIVERSITY; CONVERGENCE; ENVIRONMENT; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS; MODEL	Species abundances are important properties of ecological communities. Theoretical debate has arisen over whether communities are governed by assembly rules. Some ecologists have suggested that community organization depends on the phylogenetic relatedness of its interacting members. This postulate has not been adequately tested primarily because molecular phylogenies for entire communities are rare. We use the molecular phylogeny and species abundances from the well-studied yeasts that live in decaying cactus tissue (i.e., cactus yeast community) to demonstrate that community structure is indeed linked to genetic relatedness but that the relationship is different for the same yeasts found in hosts of two subfamilies of the Cactaceae. In the Opuntia cacti, the genetically related and unrelated yeasts have equivalent probability of being similar in abundance. Conversely, in the columnar cacti, the abundant yeast species tend to be genetically distant from one another, whereas the rare species tend to be closely related. The distinctive biochemical differences between the Opuntia and columnar cacti habitats suggest that conditions imposed by the environment modify the relationship between phylogenetic relatedness and species abundances in the cactus yeast community.

J	Arjo, WM; Pletscher, DH				Arjo, WM; Pletscher, DH			Coyote and wolf habitat use in northwestern Montana	NORTHWEST SCIENCE			English	Article							HOME-RANGE SIZE; RESOURCE SELECTION; RED FOXES; STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; NATIONAL-PARK; ROAD DENSITY; FOOD-HABITS; GRAY WOLF; MOVEMENTS	Being a habitat generalist is an adaptation strategy that has allowed the coyote to expand its range. As wolves reestablish, or are reintroduced, resident populations of coyotes may change habitat use. We compared habitat use between coyotes and wolves in Glacier National Park after successful recolonization by wolves. Two wolf packs and nine coyotes were monitored from June 1994 through June 1997 to determine habitat use in northwestern Montana. Wolves used habitat types within their home ranges in proportion to availability during the winter, but not the summer when more open areas and burned forest were used. Most coyotes used habitat types within their home ranges in proportion to availability in summer and winter. However, two coyotes used open areas more during the summer and lowland forests areas more during the winter. Coyotes may use open habitats to avoid encounters with predators other than wolves (i.e., cougars), and for access to small mammals during the summer. In addition, coyotes used areas closer to roads than wolves, and used NE-NW aspects more frequently while wolves occupied SE-SW and SW-NW aspects. Although habitat use was similar between canids, coexistence of coyotes and wolves in the Glacier National Park area may be facilitated through differential use of topographic characteristics (i.e., slope, aspect, and areas near roads).

Location: Glasshouse experiment. Results: Fertility increased community biomass towards an asymptotic maximum, and reduced the light passing through plant canopies towards an asymptotic minimum. As biomass increased, so did species richness. However, this did not seem to be a direct effect of productivity on species richness, but rather one mediated by plant density, since: (1) the richness/density relation was stronger than the richness/biomass one; (2) adding biomass to the richness/density regression did not increase its predictivity; (3) the richness/biomass relation was removed by rarefaction to 200 individuals per pot. It is therefore concluded that the richness/biomass relation observed was due to the sampling effect. Rarefaction to a small number of plants gave a quite different trend: lower richness at high biomass. This seems to be due to an increased number of subordinate species at high community biomass, and a more uneven distribution of abundance. Conclusion: The Competitive Exclusion and No-Interaction hypotheses have been seen as alternatives. We suggest that they can operate simultaneously.

We develop a multispecies community model with an evolving landscape in which the creation and destruction of habitat are dynamic and local in space. Species interactions are also local involving hierarchical competitive trade-offs. We show that dynamic landscapes can reverse the trend of increasing species richness with higher fragmentation observed in static landscapes. The increase in the species-area exponent from a homogeneous to a fragmented landscape does not occur when dynamics are turned on. Thus, temporal aspects of the processes that generate and destroy habitat appear dominant relative to spatial characteristics. We also demonstrate, however, that temporal and spatial aspects interact to influence the persistence time of individual species, and therefore, rank-abundance curves. Specifically, persistence in the model increases in habitats with faster local turnover because of the presence of dynamic corridors. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However the extent to which this is due to the effects of local environmental differences, dispersal limitation of constituent taxa, and the assignment of allopatric populations to species is uncertain. We examined the factors associated with diversity within an assemblage from the north-western shores, encompassing a spatial scale of 170 km. For both the whole assemblage, and all constituent species-complexes, spatial variance in community structure was significantly dependent upon both geographic distances between locations and local habitat variables. Pronounced effects of distance indicate limited dispersal, but our results also show that that the spatial variance explained by geographic distance alone was strongly linked to proportion of allopatric populations within a species-complex with species status. Thus, the taxonomic status of allopatric populations underlies, at least partially, the biogeographical structure of this assemblage. Substrate composition and habitat depth were also significant determinants of community structure, although spatial variance attributed to these variables was less than that associated with distance alone. Substantial unexplained variance may be a consequence of the effects of unmeasured habitat variables, high ecological similarity between co-occurring species, stochastic influences on population abundance, and the effects of local adaptation. Despite low spatial variance explained by the assessed environmental variables, significant environmental influence on cichlid assemblage structure across a wide spatial scale indicates that even slight future environmental changes may have the capacity to significantly alter species composition.

J	Madhusudan, MD				Madhusudan, MD			Recovery of wild large herbivores following livestock decline in a tropical Indian wildlife reserve	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						chital; competition; elephant; gaur; pastoralism; resource limitation; ungulate	INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; DOMESTIC HERBIVORES; LIMITING SIMILARITY; FIELD EXPERIMENTS; SYMPATRIC WILD; SERENGETI; ECOLOGY; ASSEMBLAGE; ECOSYSTEM	1. Resource competition is an important process governing the impact of livestock on native wild mammalian herbivores, an issue acknowledged to be of global conservation concern. Resource competition occurs between species when their resources (habitat and diet) overlap and are limiting. Yet the evidence that livestock compete with wild herbivores has remained weak because resource limitation is often difficult to demonstrate in the field. 2. This 2-year field study at Bandipur National Park, India, examined livestock-mediated resource limitation among five wild herbivore species: wild pig Sus scrofa, chital Axis axis, sambar Cervus unicolor, gaur Bos gaurus and Asian elephant Elephas maximus, by comparing their distribution and densities in adjoining livestock-grazed and livestock-free areas before, and after, a 49% decline in livestock density. 3. During 2001, mean densities of wild grazers, gaur (0.11 ha(-1)), chital (1.51 ha(-1)) and elephant (0.61 ha(-1)), were, respectively, 132, 11 and six times higher in the livestock-free area than in the adjacent livestock-grazed area. Densities of gaur, chital and elephant showed a sharp declining relationship with increasing livestock density, whereas no clear pattern was discernible with wild pig, a non-ruminant generalist, and the sambar, a forest browser. Preferred plant biomass also fell sharply with increasing livestock density. 4. Following the decline in livestock density in the livestock-grazed area in 2002, the densities of gaur, chital and elephant increased by a factor of 57, five and two in the same area, respectively, whereas no changes were seen in the densities of wild pig and sambar or in the preferred plant biomass. Except for a decline in elephant density, the livestock-free area did not show changes in wild herbivore densities. 5. Given the considerable overlap in habitat and dietary preference/requirements between livestock and wild herbivores in the study area, it is suggested that the recovery of gaur, chital and elephant densities following the livestock decline represents their release from livestock-mediated resource limitation. 6. Synthesis and applications. These results indicate that resource competition may be intense between wild herbivores and grazing livestock, and if left unchecked could trigger declines of wild herbivores, particularly grazing ruminants and bulk feeders. These results also suggest that, where possible, interventions to reduce livestock grazing may rapidly benefit wild herbivores that have been competitively suppressed. This has important implications for the management of livestock grazing in India's wildlife reserves.

This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of methods and investigates whether errors in model predictions are associated to specific kinds of geographical and environmental distributions of species. Location Portugal, Western Europe. Methods Probabilities of occurrence for 44 species of amphibians and reptiles in Portugal were modelled using seven modelling techniques: Gower metric, Ecological Niche Factor Analysis, classification trees, neural networks, generalized linear models, generalized additive models and spatial interpolators. Generalized linear and additive models were constructed with and without a term accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Model performance was measured using two methods: sensitivity and Kappa index. Species were grouped according to their spatial (area of occupancy and extent of occurrence) and environmental (marginality and tolerance) distributions. Two-way comparison tests were performed to detect significant interactions between models and species groups. Results Interaction between model and species groups was significant for both sensitivity and Kappa index. This indicates that model performance varied for species with different geographical and environmental distributions. Artificial neural networks performed generally better, immediately followed by generalized additive models including a covariate term for spatial autocorrelation. Non-parametric methods were preferred to parametric approaches, especially when modelling distributions of species with a greater area of occupancy, a larger extent of occurrence, lower marginality and higher tolerance. Main conclusions This is a first attempt to relate performance of modelling techniques with species spatial and environmental distributions. Results indicate a strong relationship between model performance and the kinds of species distributions being modelled. Some methods performed generally better, but no method was superior in all circumstances. A suggestion is made that choice of the appropriate method should be contingent on the goals and kinds of distributions being modelled.

J	Gebler, JB				Gebler, JB			Mesoscale spatial variability of selected aquatic invertebrate community metrics from a minimally impaired stream segment	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						spatial variability; natural variability; biomonitoring; bioassessment; metrics; study design; patchiness; effect size; autocorrelation; sampling; aquatic invertebrates	SONORAN DESERT STREAM; HIERARCHICAL FRAMEWORK; MONITORING PROGRAMS; SPECIES COMPOSITION; SIMILARITY INDEXES; INSECTS; MACROINVERTEBRATES; CLASSIFICATION; HETEROGENEITY; ASSESSMENTS	The related topics of spatial variability of aquatic invertebrate community metrics, implications of spatial patterns of metric values to distributions of aquatic invertebrate communities, and ramifications of natural variability to the detection of human perturbations were investigated. Four metrics commonly used for stream assessment were computed for 9 stream reaches within a fairly homogeneous, minimally impaired stream segment of the San Pedro River, Arizona. Metric variability was assessed for differing sampling scenarios using simple permutation procedures. Spatial patterns of metric values suggest that aquatic invertebrate communities are patchily distributed on subsegment and segment scales, which causes metric variability. Wide ranges of metric values resulted in wide ranges of metric coefficients of variation (CVs) and minimum detectable differences (MDDs), and both CVs and MDDs often increased as sample size (number of reaches) increased, suggesting that any particular set of sampling reaches could yield misleading estimates of population parameters and effects that can be detected. Mean metric variabilities were substantial, with the result that only fairly large differences in metrics would be declared significant at alpha = 0.05 and beta = 0.20. The number of reaches required to obtain MDDs of 10% and 20% varied with significance level and power, and differed for different metrics, but were generally large, ranging into tens and hundreds of reaches. Study results suggest that metric values from one or a small number of stream reach(es) may not be adequate to represent a stream segment, depending on effect sizes of interest, and that larger sample sizes are necessary to obtain reasonable estimates of metrics and sample statistics. For bioassessment to progress, spatial variability may need to be investigated in many systems and should be considered when designing studies and interpreting data.

J	Hazell, D; Hero, JM; Lindenmayer, D; Cunningham, R				Hazell, D; Hero, JM; Lindenmayer, D; Cunningham, R			A comparison of constructed and natural habitat for frog conservation in an Australian agricultural landscape	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Article						frogs; wetlands; fish; farms; Australia	SOUTHEASTERN AUSTRALIA; ADULT CHOICE; WOOD FROGS; PONDS; PREDATORS	Constructed ponds are an important consideration in the conservation of wetland biota in agricultural landscapes. Twenty-two natural ponds and 22 adjacent constructed ponds (farm dams) were surveyed on the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales to compare patterns of use by frogs and develop frog conservation recommendations. Farm dams supported similar numbers of frog species to natural ponds, although differences in frog assemblage were observed between the pond types. Limnodynastes tasmaniensis and Uperolia laevigata were significantly more likely to occur at farm dams while L. peronii was more likely to occur at natural ponds. Results suggest waterbodies with high levels of emergent vegetation cover that lack fish are likely to support a high number of frog species, regardless of origin (i.e. natural or constructed). However, it is important for landholders to conserve natural waterbodies as these environments appear likely to support frog species that do not use farm dams. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

While ecologists comprehend these imprecise scales, managers responsible for making decisions affecting these gradients need more precise information. For our study, we preserved the measurement scale and units of a dominant environmental gradient by using non-linear models to fit plant frequency to a water-level gradient ranging from shallow ground water to standing water along the Platte River in central Nebraska, USA. Non-linear models, unlike polynomials, have coefficients that can be interpreted with a biological meaning such as population peak, Optimum gradient position, and ecological amplitude. Sixty-three riparian grassland species had sufficient information to link their plant frequency to the water-level gradient. From among 10 water-level summary statistics evaluated for a subset of 22 species, the best plant-frequency response curves were obtained by using the growing season 10% cumulative frequency water level, followed closely by the growing season 7-day moving average high water level and two other high water-level statistics. This suggests that for Platte River riparian grasslands, high water levels are more influential than mean, median, or low water levels. Land-management practices (i.e., grazing, haying, and extended rest) affected six species by a change in frequency or a shift in position along the water-level gradient. Four general plant communities composed of species responding individually to the water-level gradient and other factors were identified for Platte River riparian grasslands: emergent, sedge meadow, mesic prairie, and dry ridge. Plant response curves are the first step toward predicting how plants responding to riparian-grassland water levels might also respond to river management.

We investigated whether the source-sink concept Could help to clarify the influence of habitat potential (scrub ridge characteristics), population density, and fires (shrub heights) on Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) demography and dispersal. We mapped territories and measured survival, recruitment, emigration, immigration, and shrub heights annually for 12 years. We classified territories as oak if they overlapped well-drained ridges, oak-palmetto if they overlapped poorly drained ridges >0.4 ha, and palmetto-oak if they only overlapped poorly drained ridges <0.4 ha. Territory size differed little among these categories but was negatively correlated with the annual number of breeding pairs, which ranged from 12 to 27. Scrub ridge characteristics influenced the locations of sinks and potential sources, whereas population density and fires caused temporal variation in demographic success. Oak territories were usually sources because they were net exporters of individuals and because recruitment exceeded mortality. Oak-palmetto territories sometimes functioned as sources but were often pseudo-sinks because density dependence caused mortality to exceed recruitment. Palmetto-oak territories were true sinks because they were net importers of individuals and mortality exceeded recruitment regardless of population density. All scrub was short (<1.2 m) or medium height (1.2-1.7 m), but the spatial arrangement of these height classes changed regularly because fires occurred every 2-7 years. We observed a quadratic relationship between demographic success and the area of medium-height scrub within territories. Territories that had 0.9-1.2 ha of medium-height scrub had the highest demographic success. Applying source-sink concepts at the territory scale was useful to quantify habitat variation at a spatial scale relevant to population processes, reserve design, and habitat management. Our approach can be applied by using territory maps or geographic information systems to partition heterogeneous landscapes into territories and then by classifying territories into potential sources and sinks using scrub ridge characteristics and shrub heights.

This consensus stems from physically based models of fire behavior and substantial empirical evidence. But the types of thinning and fire and where they are applied are the subjects of much debate. We propose that low thinning is the most appropriate type of thinning practice. Treating surface fuels, reducing ladder fuels, and opening overstory canopies generally produce fire-safe forest conditions, but large fire-resistant trees are also important components of fire-safe forests. The context of place is critical in assigning priority for the limited resources that will be available for restoration treatments. Historical low-severity fire regimes, because of their current high hazards and dominance by fire-resistant species, are the highest priority for treatment. Mixed-severity fire regimes are of intermediate priority, and high-severity fire regimes are of lowest priority.

Often these three approaches have been pursued in isolation. Combining them results in a more comprehensive and robust conservation strategy, but also requires the acquisition and analysis of tremendous quantities of data. Therefore, data limitations can be a significant impediment to rapid progress in conservation planning. I identify the primary surrogates of biodiversity used in current approaches to conservation planning and discuss the kinds and quality of data required. Criteria for narrowing the list of potential conservation targets to those that will be most useful include: (1) Validity: The target must be an element of conservation interest in its own right or have a well-documented or compelling relationship to such elements; (2) Data availability and uniformity: Information on selected targets must be readily available as digital, spatial databases that are relatively uniform and continuous in distribution across the planning region in order to avoid biases; and (3) Complementarity and comprehensiveness: The suite of targets selected should be complementary and span a broad spectrum of biodiversity or environmental variation. In order to make existing data more useful to conservation planning, governments should create coordinated national or continental information systems that include data on multiple surrogates of biodiversity.

An unexplored consequence is how selection on this trait affects diversity and diversification in species assemblages. Motivated by the diverse rockfish (Sebastes) assemblage in the North Pacific, the effects of trade-offs in longevity against competitive ability are explored. A competition model is developed and used to explore the potential for species diversification and coexistence. Invasion analyses highlight that life-history trait trade-offs in longevity can mitigate the effects of competitive ability and favour the coexistence of a finite number of species. Our results have implications for niche differentiation, limiting similarity and assembly dynamics in multispecies interactions.

A total of 256 taxa (including 16 subspecific taxonomic units), belonging to 65 genera, are endemic to Mexico. Some of them are close relatives of important crops, while others are used in different ways all over the country. The aim of this paper is to discuss the distribution patterns at state level of the Mexican endemic species of Poaceae. Using cluster strategies, the states are classified according to their floristic similarities. Later, hotspots of endemism are identified, in order to discuss their role in conservation strategies. To evaluate the importance of each state in the conservation of the Mexican endemic Poaceae, two iterative complementarity methods were also used. Our results show that the largest concentration of endemic taxa occurs in a few states, such as Jalisco, Mexico, Michoacan, Durango, Oaxaca, Veracruz, San Luis Potosi, Chiapas, Chihuahua, Puebla, and Coahuila. The results also show that there are some patterns in the relationship to its endemism that seem to reflect important diversification trends in the family. Accordingly, 31% of the grass genera of Mexico have at least one endemic species, and 16.7% of the genera have only one endemic species. In contrast, six genera contribute 47.2% of the total number of grass endemics in Mexico. The Chloridoideae contributes 42.9% of the total grass endemic species of Mexico, whereas the Panicoideae includes 24.6%, and the Pooideae 19.8%. Thus, these three subfamilies contribute about 87% of the species endemism. On the basis of the habitat and distribution patterns of these subfamilies, two main areas of endemicity can be identified. The first area is located in warm habitats, whereas the second is related to temperate and high regions. The cluster analyses indicate the occurrence of four state groups whose phytogeographical explanation is discussed on the basis of a floristic regionalization of Mexico. The results also indicate the need to establish a relatively high number of sites and states for the conservation of 256 endemic taxa. The elevated number of sites required to conserve the Mexican endemic Poaceae is mainly due to the fact that many taxa have a restricted distribution pattern. On the basis of the patterns obtained, a few proposals are presented for undertaking the establishment of conservation priorities of these taxa.

J	Parris, KM				Parris, KM			Environmental and spatial variables influence the composition of frog assemblages in sub-tropical eastern Australia	ECOGRAPHY			English	Article							CANONICAL CORRESPONDENCE-ANALYSIS; AMAZON RAIN-FOREST; ANTIPREDATOR DEFENSES; AMPHIBIAN ASSEMBLAGE; HABITAT REQUIREMENTS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; RIPARIAN HABITATS; SPECIES RICHNESS; LARVAL ANURAN; PREDATION	In community ecology, contrasting theories suggest that the distribution and abundance of species, and thus the composition of assemblages, are influenced by i) environmental gradients, or ii) contagious biotic processes such as predation, competition, dispersal and disease. In the former case, sites with similar environments would tend to support similar assemblages, while in the latter, geographically proximate sites would tend to support more similar assemblages than widely separated sites. I investigated the relative influence of environmental variables and spatial position on the composition of frog assemblages at forest streams in sub-tropical eastern Australia using redundancy analysis (RDA) and partial RDA. Data on the maximum abundance of the frog species at 65 survey sites were transformed such that RDA would yield the Hellinger distance between sites. The following analysis identified 11 environmental variables that explained 45% of the variation in the abundance of species at the survey sites (the species matrix), as a proportion of total variance. The geographic co-ordinates of the survey sites accounted for 12%, while the environmental and spatial variables combined accounted for 47% of the variation in the species matrix. Partial redundancy analysis indicated that of the explained variation, 74% was purely environmental, 5% was purely spatial and 21% was spatial environmental variation. This study is the first to quantify the relative influence of environmental and spatial variables on the composition of amphibian assemblages. It provides support for both the environmental control model and the biotic control model of species' distributions and assemblage composition, although environmental variables appear to have the greater effect at this scale of analysis.

Less is known about the role of resource availability and heterogeneity in restored communities, although restoration provides a valuable opportunity to test our understanding of factors that influence plant community assembly. We altered soil nitrogen (N) availability and soil depth during a prairie restoration to determine if the availability and/or heterogeneity of soil resources influenced plant community composition in restored grassland communities. Plant community responses to three levels of N availability (ambient, enriched by fertilization, and reduced by carbon amendment) and two levels of soil depth (deep and shallow) were evaluated. In addition, we evaluated plant community responses to four whole plot heterogeneity treatments created from the six possible combinations of soil N availability and soil depth. The soil depth treatment had little influence on community structure during the first 3 years of restoration. Total diversity and richness declined over time under annual N enrichment, whereas diversity was maintained and richness increased over time in soil with reduced N availability. Non-native species establishment was lowest in reduced-N soil in the initial year, but their presence was negligible in all of the soil N treatments by the second year of restoration. Panicum virgatum, a native perennial C(4) grass, was the dominant species in all soil N treatments by year three, but the magnitude of its dominance was lowest in the reduced-N soil and highest in enriched-N soil. Consequently, the relative cover of P. virgatum was strongly correlated with community dominance and inversely related to diversity. The differential growth response of P. virgatum to soil N availability led to a higher degree of community similarity to native prairie in the reduced-N treatment than in the enriched-N treatment. There were no differences in plant community structure among the four whole plot-level heterogeneity treatments, which all exhibited the same degree of similarity to native prairie. Diversity and community heterogeneity in the whole-plot treatments appeared to be regulated by the dominant species' effect on light availability, rather than soil N heterogeneity per se. Our results indicate that a strong differential response of a dominant species to resource availability in a restored community can regulate community structure, diversity, and similarity to the native (or target) community, but the importance of resource heterogeneity in restoring diversity may be dampened in systems where a dominant species can successfully establish across a range of resource availability.

J	Brose, U; Martinez, ND				Brose, U; Martinez, ND			Estimating the richness of species with variable mobility	OIKOS			English	Article							SAMPLE COVERAGE; POPULATION-SIZE; PATTERNS; NUMBER; RULES	The vast majority of species are animals that, unlike most plants and fungi, are variably and often highly mobile. While species' mobility affects species' probabilities of being sampled, effects of movement on the estimation of species richness have yet to be systematically investigated. Information-rich abundance-based estimators may be able to address variably mobile species but the accuracy of these estimators has also yet to be investigated. Here, we address both issues by variably sampling simulated landscapes with up to 250 species and evaluating the performance of ten non-parametric estimators and one species accumulation curve. Our results show that some abundance-based estimators are as accurate as better known and tested incidence-based estimators. Increased movement heterogeneity between the species reduced estimator performance by reducing the sample coverage, which systematically determined which estimator was most accurate. Based on these findings, we present the first decision framework for choosing the most accurate of many available abundance-based species-richness estimators. These decisions, based on data coverage, can significantly improve investigators' ability to estimate faunal species richness.

Here we assessed species richness, evenness, and community similarity of butterflies and odonates in landscapes located in unburned isolates and burned areas in a habitat mosaic that was severely affected by the 1997/98 ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) event in east Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo. In addition related community similarity to variation in geographic distance between sampling sites and the habitat/vegetation structure Species richness and evenness differed significantly among landscapes but there was no congruence between both taxa. The species richness of butterflies was, for example, highest in sites located in a very large unburned isolate whereas odonate species richness was highest in sites located in a small unburned isolate and once-burned forest. We also found substantial variation in the habitat/vegetation structure among landscapes but this was mainly due to variation between unburned and burned landscapes and variation among burned landscapes. Both distance and environment (habitat/vegetation) contributed substantially to explaining variation in the community similarity (beta diversity) of both taxa. The contribution of the environment was, however, mainly due to variation between unburned and burned landscapes, which contained very different assemblages of both taxa. Sites located in the burned forest contained assemblages that were intermediate between assemblages from sites in unburned forest and sites from a highly degraded slash-and-burn area indicating that the burned forest was probably recolonised by species from these disparate environments. We, furthermore, note that in contrast to species richness (alpha diversity) the patterns of community similarity (beta diversity) were highly congruent between both taxa. These results indicate that community-wide multivariate measures of beta diversity are more consistent among taxa and more reliable indicators of disturbance, such as ENSO-induced burning, than univariate measures.

We present a model to optimize the expansion of reserves for disjunct populations of all endangered species. The objective is to maximize the expected number of surviving populations subject to budget and habitat constraints. The model accounts for benefits of reserve expansion in teens of likelihood of persistence of each population and monetary cost. Solving the model with incrementally higher budgets helps prioritize sites for expansion and produces a cost curve showing funds required for incremental increases in the objective. We applied the model to the problem of allocating funds among eight reserves for the endangered San Joaquin kit fox ( Vulpes macrotis mutica) in California, USA. The priorities for reserve expansion were related to land cost and amount of already-protected habitat at each site. Western Kern and Ciervo-Panoche sites received highest priority because land costs were low and moderate amounts of already-protected habitat resulted in large reductions in extinction risk for small increments of habitat protection. The sensitivity analysis focused oil the impacts of kit fox reproductive success and home range ill non-native grassland sites. If grassland habitat is lower quality than brushland habitat resulting in higher annual variation in reproductive success or larger home ranges, then protecting habitat at the best grassland site (Ciervo-Panoche) is not cost-efficient relative to shrubland sites (Western Kern, Antelope Plain, Carrizo Plain). Finally, results suggested that lowest priority should be given to three relatively high-cost grassland sites (Camp Roberts, Contra Costa, and Western Madera) because protecting habitat at those sites would be expensive and have little effect oil the expected number of surviving kit fox populations.

J	Ulrich, W				Ulrich, W			Allometric ecological distributions in a local community of Hymenoptera	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Hymenoptera; allometric scaling; species-area relationship; biomass-species diversity relationship; species-body weight relationship; density-body weight relationship	INDIVIDUALS-AREA RELATIONSHIPS; BODY-SIZE RELATIONSHIPS; POPULATION-DENSITY; SPECIES RICHNESS; ENERGY-USE; ANIMAL ASSEMBLAGES; FRACTAL DIMENSION; GLOBAL PATTERNS; ABUNDANCE; BIODIVERSITY	The present paper describes basic ecological distributions in a community of beech forest Hymenoptera. It shows that the species diversity-body weight and the density-body weight distributions give rise to a new distribution that relates total community biomass to species diversity. For Hymenoptera this distribution follows a power function with a slope of 1.3. Combining this relation with the species-area and the individuals-area relations resulted in two other distributions that relate community biomass to area and individual numbers. It appeared that population densities decrease when computed over larger areas. The biomass-species diversity relation offers a new and simple way to estimate total community biomass from samples. The possible implications of this distribution to the productivity-diversity debate are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

J	van Rensburg, BJ; Koleff, P; Gaston, KJ; Chown, SL				van Rensburg, BJ; Koleff, P; Gaston, KJ; Chown, SL			Spatial congruence of ecological transition at the regional scale in South Africa	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Review						avian species turnover; beta-diversity; biome; heterogeneity; spatial congruence	MEASURING BETA-DIVERSITY; PRESENCE-ABSENCE DATA; BIRD-ATLAS DATA; SPECIES RICHNESS; CAPE PENINSULA; HABITAT; BIOGEOGRAPHY; PATTERNS; FOREST; BIODIVERSITY	Aim To determine whether patterns of avian species turnover reflect either biome or climate transitions at a regional scale, and whether anthropogenic landscape transformation affects those patterns. Location South Africa and Lesotho. Methods Biome and land transformation data were used to identify sets of transition areas, and avian species occurrence data were used to measure species turnover rates (beta-diversity). Spatial congruence between areas of biome transition, areas of high vegetation heterogeneity, high climatic heterogeneity, and high beta-diversity was assessed using random draw techniques. Spatial overlap in anthropogenically transformed areas, areas of high climatic heterogeneity and high beta-diversity areas was also assessed. Results Biome transition areas had greater vegetation heterogeneity, climatic heterogeneity, and beta-diversity than expected by chance. For the land transformation transition areas, this was only true for land transformation heterogeneity values and for one of the beta-diversity measures. Avian presence/absence data clearly separated the biome types but not the land transformation types. Main conclusions Biome edges have elevated climatic and vegetation heterogeneity. More importantly, elevated beta-diversity in the avifauna is clearly reflected in the heterogeneous biome transition areas. Thus, there is spatial congruence in biome transition areas (identified on vegetation and climatic grounds) and avian turnover patterns. However, there is no congruence between avian turnover and land transformation transition areas. This suggests that biogeographical patterns can be recovered using modern data despite landscape transformation.

Insights from spatial analyses of bird foraging in a tropical forest	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						facilitation; frugivory; Puerto Rico; spatial correlograms; tanagers	PUERTO-RICO; FRUIT; ABUNDANCE; FLOCKS; PLANTS; TREES; ASSEMBLAGES; PARUS	Frugivores often track ripe fruit abundance closely across local areas despite the ephemeral and typically patchy distributions of this resource. We use spatial auto- and cross-correlation analyses to quantify spatial patterns of fruit abundance and avian frugivory across a 4-month period within a forested 4.05-ha study grid in Puerto Rico. Analyses focused on two tanager species, Spindalis portoricensis and Nesospingus speculiferus, and their principal food plants. Three broad questions are addressed: (1) at what spatial scales is fruit abundance and frugivory patchy; (2) at what spatial scales do frugivores respond to fruit abundance; and (3) to what extent do spatial patterns of frugivory overlap between bird species? Fruit patch size, species composition, and heterogeneity was variable among months, despite fruit patch locations remaining relatively consistent between months. Positive correlations between frugivory and fruit abundance suggested tanagers successfully tracked fruit abundance. Frugivory was, however, more localized than fruit abundance. Scales of spatial overlap in frugivory and monthly variation in the foraging locations of the two tanager species suggested that interspecific facilitation may have been important in determining bird foraging locations. In particular, S. portoricensis, a specialist frugivore, may have relied on the loud calls of the gregarious generalist, N. speculiferus, to find new foraging areas. Such a mechanism could help explain the formation of mixed species feeding flocks and highlights the potential importance of facilitation between species that share resources.

We evaluated the nature and magnitude of such impacts by the endangered Stephens' kangaroo rat (Dipodomys stephensi), employing an exclosure experiment to determine how the removal of this species impacted relative cover by vegetation, plant species diversity, abundance of a dominant annual plant genus (Erodium), and predation of seeds from artificial trays. Fifteen months of D. stephensi removal resulted in significant increases in herb cover and Erodium abundance, and significant declines in bare ground and in seed predation. These results support the hypothesis that D. stephensi has major impacts on plant community structure and seems to function as a keystone species. It remains to be seen how the loss of this species from much of its range will influence local community composition and dynamics. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Simulations and a mean-field approximation have been used to study this neutral theory. As simulations have limitations of convergence and the mean-field approximation ignores dependencies between species' abundances when applied to species-abundance data, there is still no final conclusion whether the neutral theory or the traditional lognormal model describes community structure best. We present a novel analytical framework, based on the genealogy of individuals in the local community, to overcome the problems of previous approaches, and show, using Bayesian statistics, that the lognormal model provides a slightly better fit to the species-abundance distribution of a much-discussed tropical tree community. A key feature of our approach is that it shows the tight link between genetic and species diversity, which creates important perspectives to future integration of evolutionary and community ecological theory.

J	Edwards, MS				Edwards, MS			Estimating scale-dependency in disturbance impacts: El Ninos and giant kelp forests in the northeast Pacific	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						disturbance; El Nino; giant kelp; kelp forest; recovery	TEMPERATE REEF FISH; MACROCYSTIS-PYRIFERA; SPATIAL SCALES; INFREQUENT DISTURBANCES; SOUTHERN-CALIFORNIA; VARIANCE-COMPONENTS; RECRUITMENT; COMMUNITY; ABUNDANCE; ASSEMBLAGES	Recent discussions on scaling issues in ecology have emphasized that processes acting at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales influence ecosystems and thus there is no appropriate single scale at which ecological processes should be studied. This may be particularly true for environmental disturbances (e.g. El Nino) that occur over large geographic areas and encompass a wide range of scales relevant to ecosystem function. However, it may be possible to identify the scale(s) at which ecosystems are most strongly impacted by disturbances, and thus provide a measure by which their impacts can be most clearly described, by assessing scale-dependent changes in the patterns of variability in species abundance and distribution. This, in turn, may yield significant insight into the relative importance of the various forcing factors responsible for generating these impacts. The 1997-98 El Nino was one of the strongest El Ninos ever recorded. I examined how this event impacted giant kelp populations in the northeast Pacific Ocean at 90 sites ranging from central Baja California, Mexico to central California, USA. These sites spanned the geographic range of giant kelp in the Northeast Pacific and were surveyed just before, immediately following, several months after, more than 1 year after, and nearly 2 years after the El Nino. I used a hierarchical sample design to compare these impacts at five spatial scales spanning six orders of magnitude, from a few meters to more than 1,000 km. Variance Components Analyses revealed that the El Nino shifted control over giant kelp abundance from factors acting at the scale of a few meters (local control) to factors operating over hundreds to thousands of kilometers (regional control). Moreover, El Nino resulted in the near-complete loss of all giant kelp throughout one-half of the species' range in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Giant kelp recovery following El Nino was far more complex and variable at multiple spatial scales, presumably driven by numerous factors acting at those scales. Recovery returned local control of giant kelp populations within 6 months in southern California, and within 2 years in Baja California.

J	Hunter, JC; McCoy, RA				Hunter, JC; McCoy, RA			Applying randomization tests to cluster analyses	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE			English	Article						classification; null distribution; permutation test; resampling; vegetation	SPECIES CLUSTERS	In applying randomization tests to hierarchical cluster analyses, we have noted a potentially misleading result: within a significant group. linkages are often identified as significant even when species are randomly distributed among the group's sites. We demonstrate this through a cluster analysis of a constructed matrix with two groups of 20 sites that share no species, and within each group species are randomly distributed among sites. A randomization test identified both of the groups and all linkages within them as significant, while the same test found all linkages non-significant in the cluster analysis of a matrix containing just one of the two groups of 20 sites. In general, a non-random distribution of species within a data set shortens linkages relative to distances in null distributions derived from randomized versions of the data. This confounds efforts to identify significant sub-groups within a significant group. However. the significance of sub-groups possibly could be tested by comparing linkage distances to a null distribution derived from the randomization and clustering of a sub-matrix containing only the sites within the larger group. In essence, this comparison tests the null hypothesis that within the significant group. sites represent random assemblages of species. When applied to actual data sets. an approach involving sequential randomization tests could allow the evaluation of all nodes in a classification. increasing, the utility of randomization tests and strengthening the interpretation of groups produced by cluster analysis.

The unthinned conditions included old growth and second growth, while the thinned conditions included both even- and uneven-aged management. The structural features analyzed were stem diameter, density, basal area, and height of snags and live trees, as well as volume, diameter, and decay state of downed woody debris (DWD). As measured by these features, the relative structural complexity among the forest conditions was generally old growth > uneven-aged > second growth similar to even-aged. Although snag density was highest in second-growth forests, old growth had the highest snag basal area. Old growth also had the largest volume of DWD, second growth and even-aged had the least, and uneven-aged had an intermediate value. Unlike old growth, other treatments lacked large diameter (> 40 cm) snags and DWD. If prescriptions are changed to allow for the creation of larger snags and DWD, particularly those > 60 cm in diameter, stands can be managed to more closely resemble these structural aspects of old-growth forests.

Its future depends on landscape linkages with other bear populations that are separated by denatured habitat. We used a Geographic Information System (GIS) to identify potential landscape linkages between this isolated population and six others in Florida. Pathway lengths ranged from 60-194 km with varying potentials for facilitating black bear dispersal. Each pathway incorporated 35-88% conservation land and encountered at least 11 dispersal bottlenecks. Even pathways that incorporated extensive conservation land encountered bottlenecks that make these linkages potentially unviable. All six pathways, however, passed through greater than or equal to 95% core black bear habitat. Thus, the infrastructure for a conservation network is still largely intact. The Suwannee pathway provides the best opportunity to restore connectivity between the Greater Chassahowitzka Ecosystem (GCE) and a southward colonising bear population in the Big Bend region. However, intensification of development poses an immediate threat to maintaining connectivity between the GCE and other bear populations in Florida. Through immediate strategic planning and active conservation and restoration measures, many of the generated pathways can provide long-term connectivity. Least-cost path analyses can aid in the conservation of wide-ranging animals by providing managers with a science-based, empirically derived blueprint of potential landscape linkages.

"Shortcuts" are sought to reduce monitoring costs, most often consisting of the selection of a small number of species that are closely monitored to represent the status of many associated species and environmental correlates. Assumptions associated with such shortcuts have been challenged, yet alternative approaches remain scant. We evaluated an approach that departs significantly from the approach of selecting a few representative species. We explored two primary assertions: (1) that a coordinated multiple-species monitoring effort that collects presence-absence data on a broad range of species is a robust alternative to a few intensive single-species efforts, and (2) that the vertebrate species expected to be detected using this approach are numerous and diverse enough to represent all vertebrate species. We simulated monitoring the vertebrate species pool on an existing sample grid across the 7 million ha of public lands in the Sierra Nevada (USA) ecoregion. Based on the use of eight standard presence-absence protocols, we estimated the number of vertebrate species (excluding fish) with an adequate number of sample points within their range to detect greater than or equal to20% relative change in the proportion of points with detections between two points in time. We estimated that adequate detections would be obtained for 76% of the 465 vertebrate species, including 83% of all birds, 76% of all mammals, 65% of all reptiles, and 44% of all amphibians. Detection adequacy varied among life-history and ecological groups, but >50% of the species were adequately detected in every group with the exception of three groups: rare species, endemic species, and species of concern (33%, 24%, and 47% of associated species adequately detected, respectively). A multiple-species monitoring approach represents an effective and feasible alternative to the challenges of large-scale monitoring needs by targeting the most basic of population data for a large number and breadth of species.

These concerns are of particular interest in temperate zones of South America, where protected areas have high concentrations of endemic species. We studied roadside alien plant communities and forest-road edges in Villarrica and Huerquehue national parks in the Andean portion of south-central Chile. We sampled alien species and their abundance along 21 km of roads inside parks and 22 km outside parks, using 500-m roadside transects. We also sampled plant species and recorded their abundance in 15 transects located perpendicular to forest-road edges in four forest types. Of the 66 alien species encountered along roadsides, 61 were present outside parks and 39 inside parks. Elevation and alien species richness along roadsides were significantly and negatively correlated (R(2) = -0.56, p < 0.001). Elevation, land use, and their interaction explained 74% of the variation in alien species richness along roadsides (p < 0.001). Transects located in pasture or disturbed secondary forests had significantly more alien species. We found no significant edge effect on native and alien species richness in any forest type. Few alien species have percolated into forest interiors. Native and alien diversity in edge plots were not related. Almost half the alien species belonged to three families and 85% were native to Eurasia. Our results suggest that alien species are moving into parks along road corridors and that elevation and land use of the matrix influence these invasion processes. Our findings corroborate the importance of early detection and control of invasive species in protected areas and highlight the importance of considering surrounding matrix land use in developing conservation strategies for reserves.

J	Su, JC; Debinski, DM; Jakubauskas, ME; Kindscher, K				Su, JC; Debinski, DM; Jakubauskas, ME; Kindscher, K			Beyond species richness: Community similarity as a measure of cross-taxon congruence for coarse-filter conservation	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article							GREATER YELLOWSTONE ECOSYSTEM; RESERVE SELECTION ALGORITHMS; BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY; GEOMORPHOLOGICAL HETEROGENEITY; BIODIVERSITY; INDICATORS; BIRDS; COMPLEMENTARITY; PERSPECTIVE; MANAGEMENT	The use of a surrogate taxon in conservation planning has become questionable because recent evidence suggests that the correlation of species richness between pairs of taxa is highly variable both taxonomically and geographically. Species richness is only one measure of species diversity, however, and recent studies suggest that investigations of cross-taxon congruence should consider a broader range of assessment techniques. The cross-taxon congruence of community similarity between sites among taxa has rarely been examined and may be the most relevant measure of species diversity in the context of coarse-filter conservation strategies. We examined cross-taxon congruence patterns of species richness and community similarity (Bray-Curtis similarity) among birds, butterflies, and vascular plants in montane meadow habitats in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Although patterns of species richness (Spearman rank correlation) varied between taxa, we consistently found a positive correlation in community similarity (Mantel test) between all pair-wise comparisons of the three taxa (e. g., sites with similar bird communities also had similar butterfly communities). We suggest that the success of a surrogate taxon depends on the technique used to assess surrogacy and the specific approach to conservation planning. In the context of coarse-filter conservation, measures of community similarity may be more appropriate than measures of species richness. Furthermore, the cross-taxon congruency of community similarity in our study suggests that coarse-filter conservation may be tenable in montane meadow communities.

Plant structural refuges are good predictors of species richness for endophytic herbivores, but not for exophytic herbivores. For exophytic herbivores other traits such as relative abundance may provide refuge from parasitism. Using unbiased data on both relative abundance and larval parasitism of species in macrotepidopteran assemblages we tested the null hypothesis that percent parasitism was independent of abundance. Numerically subdominant species do not gain refuge from parasitism by persisting at low abundance. Parasitism was not different from what would be expected based on their numbers. Among numerically dominant species there was, nevertheless, a significant positive association between abundance and parasitism rate. However, dominant herbivores displayed high levels of parasitism even in the years when their abundance was low relative to other years. This suggests that dominant species may possess other traits that enhance their susceptibility to parasitoids. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Understanding pattern and process in macroecology thus presents a considerable methodological challenge, as the scales of interest are simply too large for the traditional ecological approach of experimental manipulation to be possible or ethical. Here, I summarise the methods that have been most commonly employed to explore macroecological questions, discuss important methodological issues that need to be considered when interpreting macroecological. data, and suggest likely future developments in macroecological. methodology.

J	Chiba, S				Chiba, S			Ecological and morphological patterns in communities of land snails of the genus Mandarina from the Bonin Islands	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						adaptive radiation; Bonin Islands; habitat segregation; island biology; land snails; Mandarina; morphology	CHARACTER DISPLACEMENT; NONADAPTIVE RADIATION; SYMPATRIC SPECIATION; SHELL; EVOLUTION; SHAPE; CONVERGENCE; SIZE	The land snail genus Mandarina has undergone extensive radiation within the Bonin Islands in the west Pacific. The preferred above-ground vegetation heights of sympatric species were clearly different. They separated into arboreal, semi-arboreal, exposed ground and sheltered ground ecotypes. Shells of species with different ecotypes differ markedly, but shells of species with the same ecotype are very similar to each other. Shell morphologies of some phylogenetically distantly related species with the same ecotype were indistinguishable. Character evolution estimated parsimoniously using a phylogenetic tree suggests that the speciation among sympatric species is accompanied by ecological and morphological diversification. In addition, species coexistence of Mandarina is related to niche differentiation. The above findings suggest that ecological interactions among species contribute to the ecological and morphological diversification and radiation of these land snails in this depauperate environment.

J	Dark, SJ				Dark, SJ			The biogeography of invasive alien plants in California: an application of GIS and spatial regression analysis	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						biogeography; biological invasions; California; GIS; spatial autocorrelation; spatial autoregressive models	POPULATION BIOLOGY; DIVERSITY; DETERMINANTS; INVASIBILITY; COMMUNITIES; RESERVES; TIME	The spatial distribution of invasive alien plants has been poorly documented in California. However, with the increased availability of GIS software and spatially explicit data, the distribution of invasive alien plants can be explored. Using bioregions as defined in Hickman (1993), I compared the distribution of invasive alien plants (n = 78) and noninvasive alien plants (n = 1097). The distribution of both categories of alien plants was similar with the exception of a higher concentration of invasive alien plants in the North Coast bioregion. Spatial autocorrelation analysis using Moran's I indicated significant spatial dependence for both invasive and noninvasive alien plant species. I used both ordinary least squares (OLS) and spatial autoregressive (SAR) models to assess the relationship between alien plant species distribution and native plant species richness, road density, population density, elevation, area of sample unit, and precipitation. The OLS model for invasive alien plants included two significant effects; native plant species richness and elevation. The SAR model for invasive alien plants included three significant effects; elevation, road density, and native plant species richness. The SAR model for noninvasive alien plants resulted in the same significant effects as invasive alien plants. Both invasive and noninvasive alien plants are found in regions with low elevation, high road density, and high native-plant species richness. This is in congruity with previous spatial pattern studies of alien plant species. However, the similarity in effects for both categories of alien plants alludes to the importance of autecological attributes, such as pollination system, dispersal system and differing responses to disturbance in the distribution of invasive plant species. In addition, this study emphasizes the critical importance of testing for spatial autocorrelation in spatial pattern studies and using SAR models when appropriate.

A proposed ecological framework for evaluating impacts of these spills includes individual-based population models, a site conceptual trophic model, habitat suitability maps, and a stochastic brine spill generator. Simulation results for mammal populations in the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve petroleum exploration and production (E&P) site in Oklahoma are presented. The persistence of simulated American badger (Taxidea taxus) populations decreased with increasing brine spill area. The decline in persistence and average final population size was much steeper in highly fragmented landscapes. The simulated time to extinction for prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) populations showed a threshold at 30% habitat loss from spills; above this threshold the time to extinction decreased with increasing spill area. Vole density was sensitive to the interaction of predation and fragmentation, with fragmentation causing population extinction in the presence of predation, yet stabilizing the population in the absence of predation. We anticipate that our results will aid in future development of "exclusion criteria" for leaving unrestored habitat at EP sites.

K. Hartmann in the Rychlebske Mountains, a typical mountainous area in northeastern Czech Republic. Of the original plots still covered with adult grown beech (Fagus sylvatica) forest, 22 were resampled in 1998 and 1999. In order to describe the recent vegetation variability of the sites 57 releves were recorded. Changes in vegetation were estimated using relative changes in species density and ordinations (PCA, RDA). Environmental changes were assessed using Ellenberg indicator values when no direct measurements were available. A decline in species diversity has been documented, particularly, many species occurring frequently in deciduous forests with nutrient and moisture well-supplied soils around neutral have decreased. In contrast, several light-demanding, acid- and soil desiccation-tolerant species have increased. Natural succession, quantified as forest age, contributed slightly to these changes. In Ellenberg indicator values, a decline in F (soil moisture), R (soil calcium) and N (ecosystem productivity), and an increase in L (understorey light) were shown. This is interpreted as the influence of modified forestry management and of airborne pollutants. Intensified logging caused the canopy to open and soil conditions to worsen. The latter is most likely also due to acid leaching of soil cations (Ca, K, Na). This caused a decline in soil productivity, thus the effect of nitrification could not be detected. The original releves may have differed in size influencing the results.

We found 12 traits or trait groups that have been suggested as predictors of species sensitivity: population size; population fluctuation and storage effect; dispersal power; reproductive potential; annual survival; sociality; body size; trophic position; ecological specialisation, microhabitat and matrix use; disturbance and competition sensitive traits; rarity; and biogeographic position. For each trait we discuss the theoretical justification for its sensitivity to fragmentation and empirical evidence for and against the suitability of the trait as a predictor of fragmentation sensitivity. Where relevant, we also discuss experimental design problems for testing the underlying hypotheses. There is good empirical support for 6 of the 12 traits as sensitivity predictors: population size; population fluctuation and storage effects; traits associated with competitive ability and disturbance sensitivity in plants; microhabitat specialisation and matrix use; rarity in the form of low abundance within a habitat; and relative biogeographic position. Few clear patterns emerge for the remaining traits from empirical studies if examined in isolation. Consequently, interactions of species traits and environmental conditions must be considered if we want to be able to predict species sensitivity to fragmentation. We develop a classification of fragmentation sensitivity based on specific trait combinations and discuss the implications of the results for ecological theory.

J	Karasawa, S; Hijii, N				Karasawa, S; Hijii, N			Effects of microhabitat diversity and geographical isolation on oribatid mite (Acari : Oribatida) communities in mangrove forests	PEDOBIOLOGIA			English	Article						arboreal microarthropod; geographical isolation; mangrove forest; microhabitat diversity; oribatid mite; species diversity; subtropical; tidal flooding	SPECIES-DIVERSITY; SOIL; ECOLOGY; CANOPY; JAPAN; BARK	The effects of microhabitat diversity and geographical isolation on the structure of oribatid communities were studied in mangrove forests on the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. The study took place at three sites on two islands 470 km apart. Oribatid mites (Oribatida) were extracted from leaves, branches, bark of trunks (0-50, 50-100, and 100-150 cm high) and of knee roots, and from forest-floor soil and littoral algae, each defined as a microhabitat of oribatid mites. At the 0-50 cm height, the species composition of the oribatid communities on the knee-root bark and the bark of trunks of Bruguiera gymnorrhiza differed significantly from that on the other microhabitats. This difference was attributed to tidal flooding of the mangrove forests. Cluster analysis showed that oribatid communities in the same microhabitat at different sites tended to be more similar than those on different microhabitats at the same site. This implies that the species composition of oribatid communities in mangrove forests is more likely to be affected by factors responsible for microhabitat diversity (characterized specifically by the flooded trunks) than by geographical distance between the islands.

Our goal was to determine which landscape features are important controls on species richness, to establish how these constraints are expressed at different levels of organization, and to identify hotspots of biological diversity for a particular locality. We examine the following questions: 1) How is the variance in patterns of plant species richness and diversity partitioned at different scales, or classification units, of the hierarchical ecosystem classification developed for the study area? 2) What are the compositional similarities among ecosystem types? 3) For our study area, what are the sites expected to harbour highest species richness? We used a spatially explicit map of biodiversity to project abundance of species-rich communities in the landscape based on a previously developed ecological classification system for a lower Gulf Coastal Plain landscape. The data indicate that high species richness in this ecosystem was found in sites with frequent fire and high soil moisture. Sites in fire-maintained landscapes with lower frequency of fire were associated with geomorphological characteristics, suggesting a dependence of the diversity-disturbance relationship with soil type. With more frequent fire on some sites, high diversity shifts from canopy component to ground flora, with an overall increase in total species richness. Our approach demonstrates how potential species richness can be identified as a restoration goal and that multiple vegetation endpoints may be appropriate vegetation objectives. We identify basic management needs for the maintenance of biodiversity in this ecosystem that can be derived from an understanding of the combination of factors that most strongly predict diverse plant communities.

Data of species richness (number of species) is presented from inside and outside 24 long-term exclosures in Montana, Utah, and Wyoming. For the average of all exclosures there was no difference between species richness inside and outside the exclosures. Overlap of species (those found both inside and outside of the exclosures) was high (69 to 72 percent), and the species found either inside only or outside only did not reveal any trend related to grazing or successional status. The areas inside and outside eight exclosures in Wyoming were sampled in 2 successive years. Growing season moisture was above normal the first year and far below normal the second. Species richness sampled was more than 40 percent lower in the second year than in the first. The rather small difference in species richness inside and outside all of the exclosures indicates that neither grazing nor lack of grazing has much long-term influence on species richness. However, growing season moisture can greatly influence how many species are encountered when sampling an area.

Samples were taken in the shelterbelt centre and in the field at a distance of 0.5 m, 10 m and 50 m from the tree line. Collembola were analysed in soil and in litter samples placed in containers and located in different sites, Acarina only in soil samples. Density of Collembola in soil was found to be higher in the shelterbelt than in the adjacent field (P = 0.003). Similar relationship was not, however, noted for insects in litter, density in open field was higher than in the shelterbelt. Density of Acarina in soil decreased gradually with the distance from the shelterbelt (P = 0.007). Twenty three species of springtails were found; the highest species richness (12) was noted in shelterbelts, but also in the litter in the open field. The dominant species common for soil and litter were Isotoma notabilis in the shelterbelt while isotomina thermophila and Isotoma viridis in the field. With the increasing distance from shelterbelt Proisotoma minuta increased its contribution to the soil community, Entomobryo multifasciata was the dominant only in litter. In the field soil, 50 m from woods, the highest share of young individuals was noted. The highest species richness of Oribatida was found in the field margin (18). The Tectocepheus velatus was the dominant species both in the shelterbelt. and the field, accounted for 30-70% of the total number of individuals.

J	Picard, N; Karembe, M; Birnbaum, P				Picard, N; Karembe, M; Birnbaum, P			Species-area curve and spatial pattern	ECOSCIENCE			English	Article						point process; semi-arid savanna; spatial pattern; species-abundance distribution; species-area curve	MODELS; EXPLANATIONS; OCCUPANCY; ABUNDANCE; RARITY	Various models of the relationship between area and number of resident species have been proposed. Most of them either ignore the spatial distribution of the species or suppose that they are spatially distributed at random. A new model is proposed that can deal with any type of spatial pattern, random, regular, or clustered, within the theory of point processes. It only requires that the distribution of the species be spatially homogeneous. The spatial pattern appears to modify the shape of the species-area curve as much as the species-abundance distribution. Mapped locations of trees and shrubs in a semi-arid savanna in Mali illustrate the theoretical developments, and an estimate of the expected number of species in the savanna is given. The observed number of species is consistent with the expected number, provided that the inventoried area remains spatially homogeneous.

We compared the response of vascular plants to environmental gradients to that of seven other plant, fungal and animal groups within a forest reserve in western Norway using data from 59 plots of 0.25 ha. We also examined whether the spatial changes in species (beta-2 index) of vascular plants matched that of the other groups. All seven groups responded to the same gradients in nutrient richness and humidity as the vascular plants. Furthermore, changes in species composition of vascular plants were reflected in comparable degrees of change among the "target" groups. The lower the degree of change in species composition between plots in the "target" groups relative to that of vascular plants, the higher the percentage "target" species encompassed in a complementary selection of sites based on vascular plants. We conclude that in practical site selection of small scale sites of conservation value, such as woodland key habitats, vascular plants may be used in combination with an inventory of important habitats for rare and/or redlisted forest species, such as dead wood, old trees, deciduous trees, and Cliffs.

However, there are general statistical patterns emerging on particular spatial and temporal scales, which indicate the existence of some universal principles behind many ecological phenomena, and which can even be used for the prediction of phenomena occurring on finer scales of resolution. These generalities comprise regular frequency distributions of particular macroscopic variables within higher taxa (body size, abundance, range size), relationships between such variables, and general patterns in species richness. All the patterns are closely related to each other and although there are only a few major explanatory principles, there are plenty of alternative explanations. Reconciliation of different approaches cannot be obtained without careful formulation of testable hypotheses and rigorous quantitative empirical research. Two especially promising ways of untangling ecological complexity comprise: (1) analysis of invariances, i.e. universal quantitative relationships observed within many different systems, and (2) detailed analysis of the anatomy of macroecological phenomena, i.e. explorations of how emergent multispecies patterns are related to regular patterns concerning individual species.

J	Thenail, C; Baudry, J				Thenail, C; Baudry, J			Variation of farm spatial land use pattern according to the structure of the hedgerow network (bocage) landscape: a case study in northeast Brittany	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						land use allocation; farm territory; spatial pattern; bocage landscape; mutual information; Brittany (France)	ECOLOGICAL PATTERNS; FRANCE; FRAGMENTATION; CONSOLIDATION; PROJECTS	The spatial pattern of fields and associated land use types in farms contributes to the landscape and its associated ecological dynamics. This pattern is also a component of farm management and development. This paper deals with modeling the land use spatial organization in farms according to these dual criteria. The hypothesis is tested that the location of farms along a gradient of bocage landscape-gradient of decreasing hedgerows density and increasing field size-influences their inner land use organization. The tests were based on mutual information and provided a hierarchy of driving factors of land use allocation in farms, as well as a classification of combinations of land use and field types. Three bocage sites-A, dense; B, intermediate; and C, open bocage-were chosen in northeast Brittany (France), on a 20 km(2) micro-region of conventional dairy production based on maize (Zea mays L.), grassland and winter cereals, mainly wheat (Triticum spp.). In this context, land use allocation in a farm was better explained by the characteristics of the farm territory, i.e. the actual land used by a single farm, rather than by the characteristics of the farm household/enterprise, as defined by production, socioeconomic and technical features. Farms of the open bocage showed marked concentric patterns of land use away from the farmsteads, involving progressively pastures used by dairy cows, fodder crops, pastures used by livestock and cash crops. In these farms, there was a pronounced differentiation of the fields that held simultaneously constraints of surrounding hedgerows, small size and hydromorphy. Farms of the dense bocage site were more fragmented and constraints were distributed more diversely through fields, so that land use allocation was not optimized according to the distance from the farmstead. The concentric pattern of land use was therefore distorted in these farms. At a landscape level, such distortions led to a land use mosaic dominated by large patches of specialized fields in the open bocage, and to a fine grain and heterogeneous land use mosaic in the dense bocage. This study therefore demonstrated how the structure of the farm territory in different bocage landscapes has a major influence on land use allocation in farms. The results emphasize the interaction between land use and land structuring in farm quality of management, which in turn influences the landscape structure. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

We found that power function and logarithmic SAR models overestimated species loss in the case of aggregated, fractal, and random patterns of area reduction. Instead, the modification of the power function by Plotkin et at. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97 (2000b) 10850) (S = S(0)A(z)e-(kA)) with k being a shape-adjusting parameter worked better and gave sufficient predictions of species loss. The net effects of the aggregated, fractal, and random types of area toss on species diversity were very similar with an aggregated pattern of area loss leading to slightly higher rates of species loss than both other processes. We conclude that SARs might be useful toots for biodiversity forecasting if they are constructed in a case-specific manner. The use of standard models instead might be misleading.

Soil; Hymenoptera appeared to be one of the most species-rich taxa associated with Community structure; the soil. Eighty-eight species were found in the meadow (total density of Parasitism; 128 ind. m(-2) yr(-1)) and 188 species (149 ind.m(-2)yr(-1)) in the forest. The mean Diversity parasitism rates were above 60% for parasitoids of mycetophagous Diptera and between 7% and 26% for parasitoids of saprophagous Diptera. Species overlap between both habitats was higher than expected from a random sample model. Species common to both habitats were primarily parasitoids of predatory Coleoptera. High mean densities of these species support the hypothesis of a positive correlation between local abundance and range size. (C) 2003 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

J	Carroll, C; Noss, RE; Paquet, PC; Schumaker, NH				Carroll, C; Noss, RE; Paquet, PC; Schumaker, NH			Use of population viability analysis and reserve selection algorithms in regional conservation plans	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						carnivores; conservation planning; focal species; population viability analysis; regional conservation plans; reserve selection; Rocky Mountains	NEW-SOUTH-WALES; GRIZZLY BEARS; ROCKY-MOUNTAINS; IRREPLACEABILITY; VULNERABILITY; CONNECTIVITY; RESTORATION; CARNIVORES; EXTINCTION; LANDSCAPES	Current reserve selection algorithms have difficulty evaluating connectivity and other factors necessary to conserve wide-ranging species in developing landscapes. Conversely, population viability analyses may incorporate detailed demographic data, but often lack sufficient spatial detail or are limited to too few taxa to be relevant to regional conservation plans. We developed a regional conservation plan for mammalian carnivores in the Rocky Mountain region using both a reserve selection algorithm (SITES) and, a spatially explicit population model (PATCH). The spatially explicit population model informed reserve selection and network design by producing data on the locations of population sources, the degree of threat to those areas from landscape change, the existence of thresholds to population viability as the size of the reserve network increased, and the effect of linkage areas on population persistence. A 15% regional decline in carrying capacity for large carnivores was predicted within 25 years if no addition to protected areas occurred. Increasing the percentage of the region in reserves from the current 17.2% to 36.4% would result in a 1-4% increase over current carrying capacity, despite the effects of landscape change. The population model identified linkage areas that were not chosen by the reserve selection algorithm, but whose protection strongly affected population viability. A reserve network based on carnivore conservation goals incidentally protected 76% of ecosystem types, but was poor at capturing localized rare species. Although it is unlikely that planning for focal species requirements alone will capture all facets of biodiversity, when used in combination with other planning foci, it may help to forestall the effects of loss of connectivity on a larger group of threatened species and ecosystems.

We examined the potential contributions of these areas to the conservation of biodiversity. Using GIS, we analyzed the concordance of inventoried roadless areas (IRAs) with ecoregion-scale biological importance and endangered and imperiled species distributions on a scale of 1:24,000. We found that more than 25% of IRAs are located in globally or regionally outstanding ecoregions and that 77% of inventoried roadless areas have the potential to conserve threatened, endangered, or imperiled species. IRAs would increase the conservation reserve network containing these species by 156%. We further illustrate the conservation potential of IRAs by highlighting their contribution to the conservation of the grizzly bear (Ursos arctos), a wide-ranging carnivore. The area created by the addition of IRAs to the existing system of conservation reserves shows a strong concordance with grizzly bear recovery zones and habitat range. Based on these findings, we conclude that IRAs belonging to the U.S. Forest Service are one of the most important biotic areas in the nation, and that their status as roadless areas could have lasting and far-reaching effects for biodiversity conservation.

J	Schmidt, NM; Jensen, PM				Schmidt, NM; Jensen, PM			Changes in mammalian body length over 175 years - Adaptations to a fragmented landscape?	CONSERVATION ECOLOGY			English	Article							OTTERS LUTRA-LUTRA; TERRESTRIAL MAMMALS; POPULATION-DENSITY; ISLAND RULE; ROAD-KILLS; SIZE; PATTERNS; DENMARK; GERMANY; AREA	The potential consequences of anthropogenic habitat fragmentation on species diversity and extinction have drawn considerable attention in recent decades. In many cases, traditional island biogeography theory has been applied to explain the observed patterns. Here, we propose that habitat fragmentation as a selective force can be traced in mammalian body length changes. By exploring historical sources, we are able to show that the body length of Danish mammals has altered over a period of 175 years, possibly in response to increasing habitat fragmentation. The rate of body length change was generally lowest in medium-sized mammals, and increased with both smaller and larger body mass. Small mammals have generally increased, whereas large mammals have decreased in length. In addition to habitat fragmentation, some species may experience other selective forces, such as traffic, and may be trapped in an evolutionary tug-of-war, where the selective forces pull in opposite directions.

J	Stevens, MHH; Petchey, OL; Smouse, PE				Stevens, MHH; Petchey, OL; Smouse, PE			Stochastic relations between species richness and the variability of species composition	OIKOS			English	Article							STATISTICAL INEVITABILITY; ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY; STABILITY; BIODIVERSITY; POPULATIONS; SIMILARITY; CONSEQUENCES; ABUNDANCE	Ecological communities change over time and space, and ecologists have long suggested that biodiversity might influence the rate of change. Here we cast new light on this question by demonstrating statistical covariation between species richness and the variability of species abundances and identities within a community (compositional variability). We provide a new analytical framework for several previously published measures of ecosystem functioning and compositional variability. We derive three related variances, each of which measures compositional variability due solely to stochastic sampling processes. Our analyses show that whether relations between species richness and compositional variability are positive, negative or zero, depends on two factors. Not only does the particular variance used affect the relation, but, more importantly, the underlying determinants of species richness can strongly affect the stochastic relations between species richness and compositional variability. This analysis makes clear for the first time how species richness should correlate with important measures of community variability, even in the absence of systematic processes.

Draining peat swamp areas for agricultural uses creates a high risk of sulfuric acidification. The research site in this paper was a strand plain comprising beach ridges, swales on inter-ridges, and peaty backswamps in southeast Thailand. Thus, the actual and potential acid sulfate soil in the peaty backswamps is a major problem there, but sandy podzols on older beach ridges are also considered an agricultural problem soil. To establish an agricultural landscape plan encompassing the whole of the strand plain, we studied the land characteristics associated with the landforms and soils, their spatial variability related to landscape evolution, and the status of present plant resources in terms of biomass and species diversity for local farmers on peaty backswamps and beach ridges. We found that all spatial attributes of the two soils, such as the locations, profiles, and chemical and physical properties, were closely related to the geomorphic formation process or chronosequence: the landward or older backswamp has ripe clay and the seaward or younger one partly has unripe clay; the degree of spodic horizon development with ortstein is highest in the most landward beach-ridge system and decreases seaward; and the profile positions of the spodic horizons were related to the fluctuations of marine sand sediments, as revealed in a fine-scale survey. Finding these spatial regularities is useful for predicting land characteristics in areas outside of detailed research sites, reducing time and cost as well as forming the basis of landscape planning. Plant resources presently utilized by local farmers on the strand plain are Melaleuca cajuputi forests on both the peaty backswamps and the beach ridges, and home gardens of tropical fruit trees around settlements. Ecological carrying capacity in terms of biomass of M. cajuputi was not significantly different among soil types in the strand plain, but the growth rate and potential biomass of the species appears to be highest in thick, water-saturated peaty backswamps with acid sulfate soils. By comparing the species composition of home gardens in different areas, we found that oil the beach ridges, although the ecological carrying capacity in terms of biomass for several types of fruit trees appears lower, a great number of species particular to the shrub layer are maintained. Based on the spatial variability of land characteristics and the ecological carrying capacity in terms of biomass, we identified separate land units and suggested future land-management and land-use systems appropriate to each unit.

Because of their large area requirements and long dispersal movements, mammalian carnivores can be effective focal species to use when evaluating landscape-level connectivity. Our goat was to make an initial assessment of the extent of landscape-level connectivity in coastal southern California using mountain lions (Fells concolor [Linnaeus]) and bobcats (Fells rufus [Shreber]) as focal species. We first characterized habitat preferences for mountain lions and bobcats from previously derived habitat relationship models for these species; the resulting maps provided a coarse view of habitat preferences for use at regional scales. We then constructed GIS models to evaluate the disturbance impact of roadways and development, major determinants of carnivore distribution and abundance in the south coast region. Finally, we combined the habitat relationship models with the disturbance impact models to characterize habitat connectivity for mountain lions and bobcats in the ecoregion. Habitat connectivity in the ecoregion appeared higher for bobcats than for mountain lions due in part to higher habitat suitability for bobcats in coastal lowland areas. Our models suggest that much of the key carnivore habitat in the coastal southern California is at risk; over 80% of high suitability habitat and over 90% of medium suitability habitat for carnivores is found in the least protected land management classes. Overall, these models allow for (1) identification of core habitat blocks for carnivores and key landscape connections between core areas, (2) evaluation of the level of protection of these areas, and (3) a regional framework within which to develop and coordinate local management and conservation plans.

Intensive land use in the past has had, and forestation and grass planting at present will have inevitable impacts on plant biodiversity in the Loess Plateau. Based on the analysis of floristic features within three sampling sites with different land use practices and analysis of species richness among different land use types, we discuss impacts of land use on species richness and floristic features in the Northern Loess Plateau. The results drawn from this case study are as follows: ( 1) It appears that forestation and grass planting have had a positive influence on the local species diversity, but they have contributed little to the native vegetation in terms of conserving its floristic features. ( 2) Caragana intermedia shrubland, Pinus tabulaeformis forestland, and natural grassland have made important contributions to supporting indigenous species and maintaining local plant biodiversity. ( 3) There is a significant positive correlation between land use diversity and species richness. These results imply that practicing biodiversity conservation in situ is feasible and the suitable choice for the Loess Plateau. Concrete measures for biodiversity conservation in the area can include setting up small nature reserves and diversifying land use patterns to maintain as much habitat as possible for native vegetation. The artificial Hippophae rhamnoides shrubland should not be further promoted, considering its negative influence on biodiversity conservation.

Methodological rigor and scientific defensibility are enhanced by conceptual frameworks, standards, and criteria for guiding and evaluating individual plans. The Wildlands Project is developing wildlands network designs in various regions across North America, based on the goals of rewilding-restoration of wilderness qualities and intact food webs and biodiversity conservation. The project employs such modern conservation planning tools as spatially explicit habitat and population models and site-selection algorithms. I created a checklist to assist staff, contractors, and cooperators with the Wildlands Project in the development of regional conservation assessments and wildlands network designs that are consistent with currently accepted standards for science-based conservation planning. The checklist also has proven useful in the peer review of plans. The checklist consists of eight general standards, each of which includes several specific criteria that relate to the qualifications of staff, choice of biodiversity surrogates and goals, methodological comprehensiveness and rigor, replicability, analytic rigor, peer review, and overall quality of scholarship. Application of the checklist is meant to be flexible and to encourage creativity and innovation. Nevertheless, every plan must be scientifically defensible and must make the best use of available data, staff, and resources. Moreover, some degree of consistency is required to link individual plans together into a continental-scale network. The checklist may provide a template that other conservation organizations, agencies, scientists, and activists can adapt to their programs.

J	Pauchard, A; Alaback, PB; Edlund, EG				Pauchard, A; Alaback, PB; Edlund, EG			Plant invasions in protected areas at multiple scales: Linaria vulgaris (Scrophulariaceae) in the west Yellowstone area	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						exotic plant species invasion; protected areas; multi-scale method; Linaria vulgaris; Yellowstone National Park; Gallatin National Forest; boundary issues; landscape analysis; clonal patch; spatial distribution	NATIONAL-PARK; EXOTIC PLANTS; DIVERSITY; PATTERN; BIOLOGY; MILL	Invasive alien plants have long been recognized as a threat to low-elevation, disturbed environments, but the case of Linaria vulgaris Mill. in Yellowstone National Park and Gallatin National Forest shows that invasions can also spread to high-elevation natural reserves. Because invasions in protected areas are a product of complex processes occurring over a broad range of scales, we argue that a multi-scale research approach is needed to capture both patterns and potential mechanisms of the invasion process. Mapping L. vulgaris at the landscape scale, we found the species occupying a broad range of sites, apparently originating from just 2 historical sources, colonizing both human-caused and natural disturbances. Analyzed at the stand scale, patches tend to aggregate in newly invaded areas and disperse in heavily infested areas. The data suggest that patches grow in size by clonal growth and in number by creation of new satellite patches. Radial patch growth rates are related to site characteristics. Clonal patch scale analysis shows that ramet densities and Linaria's effects on native plants are highest in patch centers. Both mean ramet height and reproductive vs. vegetative ramet height ratio are higher in patch cores. These results suggest that L. vulgaris may displace natural vegetation by maintaining vigor even in large and old clonal patches. Our results confirm that L. vulgaris is a significant threat to native biodiversity in open, human- or naturally disturbed environments in protected areas of the Rocky Mountains. A multi-scale method can allow managers to better understand patterns of invasion and prioritize managemerit activities to control invasive alien plants, especially in heterogeneous protected area landscapes.

Few studies have used rigorous demographic data to demonstrate the direct and indirect effects of habitat fragmentation. We trapped deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) at five sites over two years in southwest Oregon, USA, and used multi-state capture-recapture models to estimate deer mouse survival and movement in clearcuts; forest-fragment edges, forest-fragment interiors, and contiguous forests. We also estimated deer mouse densities in fragmented and unfragmented forests and combined deer mouse demographic studies with trillium (Trillium ovatum) seed predation trials to link deer mouse changes to reduced trillium recruitment previously observed at the same study sites. Mouse survival was highest in clearcuts, intermediate in forest fragments, and lowest in unfragmented.(control) forests. Mouse movement among clearcuts, forest edges, and forest interiors was common over short time intervals. Collectively, demographic rates led to mouse densities that were 3-4 times higher at forest-fragment sites than at unfragmented sites. Trillium seeds were similar to3 times more likely to be depredated in areas of elevated relative mouse abundance than in areas of lower relative abundance. Forest fragmentation has favored mouse populations, resulting in increased seed predation that may decrease recruitment rates and increase local extinction risks for trillium.

The three sampling schemes consisted of a hexagon representation developed by the EPA/EMAP program (statistical basis), watershed boundaries (ecological), and the current county boundaries of Utah (socio-political). Four decision criteria were used to estimate effects, including amount of area, length of edge, lowest number of contiguous reserves, and greatest number of terrestrial vertebrate species covered. A fifth evaluation criterion was the effect each sampling scheme had on the ability of the modeled conservation reserves to cover the six major ecoregions found in Utah. Of the three sampling schemes, county boundaries covered the greatest number of species, but also created the longest length of edge and greatest number of reserves. Watersheds maximized species coverage using the least amount of area. Hexagons and watersheds provide the least amount of edge and fewest number of reserves. Although there were differences in area, edge and number of reserves among the sampling schemes, all three schemes covered all the major ecoregions in Utah and their inclusive biodiversity.

J	Nee, S; Stone, G				Nee, S; Stone, G			The end of the beginning for neutral theory	TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION			English	Article							SUBSTITUTION; DIVERSITY; MODELS	The point of ecology is to understand the distribution and abundance of species. Neutral models of species' abundances, which suppose that these fluctuate entirely at random, are currently enjoying considerable attention. To date, much of the credibility of such models has been based on their ability to mimic observed abundance distributions. A new paper by Brian McGill shows that, at least for some data, neutral theory performs worse than does an older, simpler null model. However, this is not the end for neutral theory: rather, it is the 'end of the beginning'.

Leaf material from 104 trees was collected from three naturally fragmented gallery forest patches and three plots in nearby continuous forest in the Mountain Pine Ridge, Belize. In total, 30 RAPD bands generated by five decamer primers were used to compare the genetic diversity of the six populations in the two groups. Genetic variation within the populations (H-0), as estimated by the Shannon diversity index, ranged from 0.32 to 0.38, with an overall diversity of 0.38 (H-species). Analysis of molecular variation revealed that most (94.4%, P<0.001) of the variation was attributable to differences among individuals within populations. Population differentiation was significantly ( P = 0.038) lower among the fragmented populations than among continuous forest populations. On average, the fragmented populations also had slightly, but statistically significant ( P = 0.046) lower levels of genetic diversity. However, one gallery forest site had a higher level of genetic diversity than two of the continuous forest sites. We suggest that the long-term effect of fragmentation on the genetic diversity of tropical trees will depend upon the amount of local forest cover in proximity to the fragmented populations.

There were distinct differences in both the seed bank composition and the aboveground vegetation between the off-prairie dog colony treatments and the on-colony treatments. The three on-colony treatments were similar to each other at all three sites with vegetation dominated by the forbs Dyssodia papposa, Hedeoma spp., Sphaeralcea coccinea, Conyza canadensis, and Plantago patagonica and seed banks dominated by the forbs Verbena bracteata and Dyssodia papposa. The two off-colony treatments were also similar to each other at all three sites. Vegetation at these sites was dominated by the grasses Pascopyrum smithii, Bromus tectorum and Bouteloua gracilis and the seed banks were dominated by several grasses including Bromus tectorum, Monroa squarrosa, Panicum capillare, Sporobolus cryptandra and Stipa viridula. A total of 146 seedlings representing 21 species germinated and emerged from off-colony treatments while 3069 seedlings comprising 33 species germinated from on-colony treatments. Fifteen of the forty species found in soil seed banks were not present in the vegetation, and 57 of the 82 species represented in the vegetation were not found in the seed banks. Few dominant species typical of mixed-grass prairie vegetation germinated and emerged from seed banks collected from prairie dog colony treatments suggesting that removal of prairie dogs will not result in the rapid reestablishment of representative mixed-grass prairie unless steps are taken to restore the soil seed bank.

Since such land use changes may cause large alterations in the birch forest ecosystems, indicators suitable for defecting and monitoring impacts need to be pursued. In this study, we used a three-table ordination method (RLQ analysis) to identify species traits in bird assemblages indicating changes in environmental attributes at stand and landscape level. RLQ analysis has the advantage of linking species traits directly to environmental attributes, hence detecting the major ecological impacts of land use change, as well as a set of species traits sensitive to these alterations. Birds and environmental attributes were sampled in six forest types in 12 different landscapes. To assess whether species traits were relatively consistent geographically and temporally, two different geographic regions and years were also included in our study design. We found the species traits investigated here to be promising indicators of land use impacts. In particular, ground nesters, cavity nesters, flycatchers, and long-distance migrants were adversely affected by conditions in elderly spruce plantations. Also, species that forage on trunks and in deciduous foliage, as well as species that eat larvae and flying insects, were. related to forests with a deciduous overstory. Despite the variety of species traits reflecting ecological changes at the stand level, only the species sensitive to the reduction in area of rich birch forests responded to fragmentation effects at the landscape level. These effects of land use changes appeared to be consistent in time (years) and space (geographic regions). We argue that knowledge about trait-environmental linkages is essential when selecting indicators for monitoring land use impacts. To best separate human effects from natural fluctuations, major environmental attributes that vary naturally in time and space should also be monitored in conjunction with the indicator species traits. Finally, trait-environmental linkages, could form the basis of making predictions about changes in biological and functional diversity in response to land use changes. These predictions could subsequently be evaluated in monitoring programs.

I conducted a series of algal and macrofanual sampling programs and manipulative algal-placement experiments in different Monterey Canyon head sub-habitats and seasons from 1988 to 1991 to elucidate the dynamics of macroinvertebrate associations with sunken drift macrophytes, severe annual sediment-flushing events, and the physical and chemical changes associated with these agents of subsidy and disturbance. Conducting these investigations in such a highly disturbed and subsidized setting, i.e., with multiple niche axes, would enable novel insights into how biological communities are structured. Up to 5.7 X 10(5) individual macrofauna/m(2) inhabited naturally occurring patches of sunken drift algae in Monterey Canyon's shallow head (Monterey Bay, California, USA), and the seasonally changing mosaics of macrophyte subsidies led to conspicuously converse responses of amphipods and polychaetes. Amphipods dominated natural patches of sunken algae during winter and spring, while polychaetes dominated during late summer and fall. This community shift corresponded with temporal changes in algal composition, dissolved oxygen (DO), and annual flushing disturbances. Repeated algal-colonization experiments in different habitats further highlighted the contrasting responses of amphipods and polychaetes to drift algae and other habitat characteristics. Mean abundances of motile amphipods increased between 8- and 148-fold within five days after placement of Enteromorpha patches (up to >4 X 10(5) individuals/m(2)) while abundances less than doubled in Macrocystis treatments. Amphipod species colonized Enteromorpha treatments in significantly greater numbers than any controls irrespective of date and sub-habitat. Polychaete species did not colonize algae treatments in significant numbers within five days, but experiments did reveal significant temporal and habitat differences in this group. Sampling of swimming macrobenthos in different canyon habitats and depths (including 30, 100, 300, and 500 m) revealed temporal and habitat patterns in crustaceans and provided explanations of guild functional contrasts. Attributes of two "evolutionary renegades," the phytic polychaete Platynereis bicanaliculata and the hypoxia-tolerant crustacean Nebalia sp., indicated that adaptive constraints inherent in the phenologies and life histories of the two partitioned guilds help reinforce normal functional boundaries. Maximum species richness at intermediate DO and time since disturbance resulted from complementary responses of the two guilds to temporal and habitat characteristics that are shaped by an interacting regime of algal subsidy, hypoxia, and severe flushing disturbance.

We found that cowbirds used the urban areas for foraging and roosting and traveled into the 3240 ha. wildland preserve of ponderosa pine in the mornings to parasitize songbird hosts. Cowbird abundance decreased with distance from the urban/wildland boundary, and Plumbeous Vireo (Vireo plumbeus) nests closer to the urban/wildland boundary were more likely to be parasitized by cowbirds than those farther away. A linear regression accurately predicted the relative abundance of cowbirds based on parameters of distance from residential areas, and distance from roads and trails within the wildland preserve. For species of concern that are known cowbird hosts, creating larger preserves, reducing residential encroachment, and reducing preserve perforation by roads and trails might alleviate high frequencies of parasitism for a portion of the host population. However, even large preserves, such as found in Boulder, CO, USA cannot insulate all focal nesting species from the urban effect of increased brood parasitism. Efforts to reduce food resources and cover for cowbirds in the urban areas might prove to ameliorate host reproductive success close to the urban/wildland boundary through decreases in cowbird abundance.

Features given quantitative conservation targets were land classes, localities of Proteaceae and selected vertebrate (freshwater fish, amphibians and reptiles) species, population sizes for medium- and large-sized mammals, and six types of spatial surrogates for ecological and evolutionary processes. The plan was developed in several stages using C-Plan, a decision support system linked to a geographic information system. Accepting the existing reserve system as part of the plan, we first selected spatially fixed surrogates for biodiversity processes; then we included those planning units that were essential for achieving targets for land classes, Proteaceae and vertebrate species; next we included areas required to accommodate population and design targets for large and medium-sized mammals; we then selected planning units required to conserve entire upland-lowland and macroclimatic gradients; and finally we resolved the options for achieving remaining targets while also consolidating the design of conservation areas. The result was a system of conservation areas, requiring, in addition to the existing reserve system, 52% of the remaining extant habitat in the planning domain, as well as restorable habitat, that will promote the persistence and continued diversification of much of the region's biota in the face of ongoing habitat loss and climate change. After describing the planning process, we discuss implementation priorities in relation to conservation value and vulnerability to habitat loss, as well as socio-economic, political and institutional. constraints and opportunities.

J	Henkel, TW				Henkel, TW			Monodominance in the ectomycorrhizal Dicymbe corymbosa (Caesalpiniaceae) from Guyana	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY			English	Review						Caesalpiniaceae; ectomycorrhiza; forest ecology; Guyana; monodominance; Neotropics	TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST; INTERCONNECTING HOST PLANTS; KORUP-NATIONAL-PARK; VEGETATIVE MYCELIUM; TACHIGALIA-VERSICOLOR; PINUS-CONTORTA; TREE SEEDLINGS; MOIST FORESTS; MARACA-ISLAND; WOODY-PLANTS	Dominance of primary rain forests by the ectomycorrhizal, leguminous canopy tree Dicymbe corymbosa (Caesalpiniaceae) was investigated in the Pakaraima Mountains of western Guyana. In five 1-ha forest inventory plots in the Upper Ireng and Upper Potaro River drainages basal areas of D. corymbosa ranged from 38.4-52.8 m(2) ha(-1) (63-85% of total) among all trees greater than or equal to10 cm diameter at breast height (dbh), values in the upper range for tropical moist forests worldwide. The high basal areas for D. corymbosa were due to the prevalence of large (>150 cm dbh), multi-stemmed individuals. Stem densities in Dicymbe plots ranged from 276-433 ha(-1), with D. corymbosa contributing 24.6-59.8%. In three 1-ha mixed forest plots adjacent to the Dicymbe plots, D. corymbosa was absent. In the mixed forests, stem densities were higher (480-585 ha(-1)), basal areas were lower (36.7-39.8 m(2) ha(-1)), species diversity was higher, and canopy tree species were more equitably distributed than in the Dicymbe plots. Tree community composition was not qualitatively different between Dicymbe and mixed forests. In the Dicymbe plots, mean sapling and seedling densities of D. corymbosa were significantly higher than most other canopy species, indicating persistent monodominance. Edaphic variation did not account for variation in forest composition. Life history traits are discussed which may contribute to clumping in D. corymbosa, including coppicing and mast-fruiting, and the potential role of litter-trapping physiognomy and ectomycorrhiza-mediated nutrient dynamics in promoting monodominance is noted.

The high levels of biodiversity in the CFR are matched by complex and fragmented social, institutional, policy and management systems. The development of a coherent strategy for the conservation of the biodiversity of the CFR, therefore, called for an innovative and adaptive approach, which would ensure the functional alignment of a wide variety of stakeholders and processes. This paper describes the generic methodologies used for the CAPE strategy development process and their specific adaptation to this project. The process adopted a two-pronged method, termed 'the nutcracker approach', which combined top-down rigour and bottom-up participation. This was necessary in order to meet the differing needs of potential international donors and South African stakeholders at national, provincial and local levels. A range of supporting tools was used, including Strategic Environmental Assessment and the Theory of Constraints. It was recognised that effective implementation has been a major stumbling block in other similar initiatives. Several elements of the strategy development methodology were therefore specifically aimed at promoting implementation. These included ensuring that the potential implementers of the strategy took part in the process and by so doing develop a sense of ownership of the outcomes, piloting the strategy in-a case-study area, integrating the strategy with existing initiatives, prioritising actions for implementation, and promoting early implementation of projects consistent with the general strategic direction. There are initial indications that the CAPE strategy is having a positive impact. The paper concludes by identifying ten principles which can be applied to the development of biodiversity conservation strategies elsewhere. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Metcalfe-Smith, JL; Di Maio, J; Staton, SK; De Solla, SR				Metcalfe-Smith, JL; Di Maio, J; Staton, SK; De Solla, SR			Status of the freshwater mussel communities of the Sydenham River, Ontario, Canada	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST			English	Article							UNIONIDAE; BIVALVIA; BASIN; FAUNA	The Sydenham River, a tributary to Lake St. Clair in southwestern Ontario, historically Supported the richest freshwater mussel community of any river in Canada. Surveys conducted between 1971 and 1991 suggested that the mussel fauna was in decline, with only 13 to 26 of the 33 native species still present. We conducted timed searches (4.5 person-h/site) for mussels at 17 sites in 1997-1998 and additional sampling at several sites in 1998-1999 and found 30 live species, including one new record for the system (Obliquaria reflexa). Four of five species recently designated as endangered in Canada, i.e., Epioblasma triquetra, Villosa fabalis, Simpsonaias ambigua and Epioblasma torulosa rangiana, were found alive in the east branch; the first three species are found nowhere else in Canada. Although the mussel community is in a better state than previously thought, there are signs that conditions are deteriorating. Lampsilis fasciola appears to be extirpated from the system although it is still found in other Ontario rivers. Obovaria subrotunda and L. siliquoidea have significantly declined in the east branch. There is some evidence that L. cardium, Strophitus undulatus and V iris are also declining in the east branch. Truncilla truncala and Leptodea fragilis may be declining in the north branch. Furthermore, several tolerant species, i.e., Potamilus alatus, Quadrula quadrula, Lasmigona complanata complanata and L. costata are significantly expanding their ranges, especially in the east branch. The latter finding suggests that increases in opportunistic species could provide an earlier warning of environmental degradation than the gradual decline of sensitive species that are often rare to begin with. The primary land use in the Sydenham River basin is agriculture (mainly row crops), and there is all extensive tile drainage system. Increased sedimentation, reduced water clarity and the loss of fish hosts are likely causes of the observed changes in the mussel community. The east branch of the river Currently supports 28 species, whereas the smaller north branch sustains only 15 species. These differences were attributed to better water quality, swifter flows and a greater variety of habitat types in the east branch. The mussel fauna of the Sydenham River is nationally and globally important and should be preserved.

J	Pressey, RL; Cowling, RM; Rouget, M				Pressey, RL; Cowling, RM; Rouget, M			Formulating conservation targets for biodiversity pattern and process in the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION			English	Review							MONKEY BEETLES SCARABAEIDAE; RESERVE SELECTION; BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY; RENOSTERVELD SHRUBLANDS; PLANT CONSERVATION; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; FOREST FRAGMENTS; FUTURE THREATS; NATIONAL-PARKS; CLIMATE-CHANGE	The Cape Floristic Region of South Africa is a global biodiversity hotspot. In 1998, a process of conservation planning began in the region that required quantitative targets for biodiversity. We combined new information and previously available data sets on biodiversity pattern and process to formulate targets for five groups of features: 102 broad habitat units (land types); locality records for 364 plant species in the family Proteaceae; locality records for 345 species of reptiles, amphibians and freshwater fish; estimated distributions and densities of 41 species of large and medium-sized mammals; and six types of spatial surrogates for ecological and evolutionary processes. We discuss our approach to formulating quantitative targets in the context of the general role of targets in conservation planning, the inadequacy of commonly used standard targets such as 10% of features or whole regions, and the uncertainties around setting targets for land types. We then describe our reasoning and methods for analysing data and identifying targets for each group of features. Our targets are not theoretical-they have been used to develop a regional conservation plan for which implementation is underway. Our targets are, however, provisional. Like any other conservation targets, they are estimates of the requirements for persistence of a region's biodiversity made within the constraints of limited information. We expect them to be improved in future reviews of appropriate targets for the Cape Floristic Region and elsewhere. Crown Copyright (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Gaston, KJ; Blackburn, TM; Goldewijk, KK				Gaston, KJ; Blackburn, TM; Goldewijk, KK			Habitat conversion and global avian biodiversity loss	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						birds; global numbers; land-use change; populations	FOREST BIRD COMMUNITY; LAND-USE; ENERGY THEORY; EXTINCTION; POPULATIONS; DIVERSITY; MIGRATION; CLIMATE	The magnitude of the impacts of human activities on global biodiversity has been documented at several organizational levels. However, although there have been numerous studies of the effects of local-scale changes in land use (e.g. logging) on the abundance of groups of organisms, broader continental or global-scale analyses, addressing the same basic issues remain largely wanting. None the less, changing patterns of land use, associated with the appropriation of increasing proportions of net primary productivity by. the human population, seem likely not simply to have reduced the diversity of life, but also to have reduced the carrying capacity of the environment in terms of the numbers of other organisms that it can sustain. Here, we estimate the size of the existing global breeding bird population, and then make a first approximation as to how much this has been modified as a consequence of land-use changes wrought by human activities. Summing numbers across different land-use classes gives a best current estimate of a global population of less than 100 billion breeding bird individuals. Applying the same methodology to estimates of original land-use distributions suggests that conservatively this may represent a loss of between a fifth and a quarter of pre-agricultural bird numbers. This loss is shared across a range of temperate and tropical land-use types.

Systems are seen as either unconditionally or conditionally stable with little distinction and therefore much ambiguity in the likelihood of stability. First, we reexamine Hurwitz's principal theorem for stability and propose two "Hurwitz criteria" that address different aspects of instability: positive feedback and insufficient lower-level feedback. Second, we derive two qualitative metrics based on these criteria: weighted feedback (wF(n)) and weighted determinants (wDelta(n)). Third, we test the utility of these qualitative metrics through quantitative simulations in a random and evenly distributed parameter space in models of various sizes and complexities. Taken together they provide a practical means to assess the relative degree to which ambiguity has entered into calculations of stability as a result of system structure and complexity. From these metrics we identify two classes of models that may have significant relevance to system research and management. This work helps to resolve some of the impasse between theoretical and empirical discussions on the complexity and stability of natural communities.

Although edge and core habitats are often recognized, it is commonly assumed in theory and in studies of a particular habitat type that reserves or patches of different sizes have similar habitat structure. However, for older, highly fragmented landscapes it has been suggested that small areas are of conservation interest as high-quality remnants, whereas large areas are more degraded. We studied 49 randomly selected forest reserves in the size range 5-230 ha (typical for many highly fragmented landscapes) and 3653 sites of key habitat (unprotected deciduous broadleaf forest). Structures in forest that are generally correlated with value for biodiversity were measured, and reserve objectives were examined from declaration texts. Both the density of large trees and the density of dead wood (snags, logs) decreased with increasing reserve size. The mean size of identified key habitats was very small (1.6 ha). A botanical objective for establishment of reserves was more frequently used for smaller reserves. In contrast, cultural and especially recreational objectives were more commonly used when larger reserves were established, suggesting higher values for recreation in these reserves. For vascular plants, birds and beetles, a literature review indicated that small forest patches do not contain impoverished communities, but are often rich (per unit of area). Small reserves and key habitats have several disadvantages, but they are probably important components of reserve networks for biodiversity in highly fragmented landscapes.

J	Mistak, JL; Hayes, DB; Bremigan, MT				Mistak, JL; Hayes, DB; Bremigan, MT			Food habits of coexisting salmonines above and below Stronach Dam in the Pine River, Michigan	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES			English	Article						dam removal; diet study; electivity; Salvelinus fontinalus; Salmo trutta; Oncorhynchus mykiss	INVERTEBRATE DRIFT; BROOK TROUT; SALVELINUS-FONTINALIS; STOMACH CONTENTS; MOUNTAIN STREAM; BROWN TROUT; REMOVAL; DIET; COMMUNITIES; SELECTION	Although dam removal has become an increasingly popular tool for river restoration, there is limited knowledge regarding the ecological effects of dam removal. The purpose of our study was to document feeding habits of coexisting brook charr, brown trout, and rainbow trout above and below a dam that is in the process of a staged removal. Modification of sediment transport caused by Stronach Dam since 1912 has affected stream channel configuration, fish habitat, and many other physical and biological processes. In order to document salmonine feeding habits above and below the dam, we selected zones to represent downstream conditions and areas of river upstream of the dam that encompassed the original reservoir and a stretch of river further upstream that was not hydraulically influenced by the dam. Because physical habitat largely governs aquatic community composition in streams, we expected these effects to be reflected in the fish and macroinvertebrate communities. In particular, we expected limited prey availability and salmonine feeding in the impacted upstream and downstream zones characterized by fine substrate composition and greater macroinvertebrate diversity and salmonine feeding opportunities in the nonimpacted zone characterized by coarse substrate. We also expected mean percent wet stomach content weights to be higher downstream, as other studies have documented an increase in piscivory on blocked migratory prey species downstream of dams. Contrary to expectations, the downstream zone of the river contained the highest abundance of drifting invertebrate taxa and, although differences in habitat occurred among the zones, the diversity of drifting macroinvertebrates and stomach contents of salmonines were similar throughout the river. Thus, in this case, the presence of altered habitat caused by a dam did not appear to negatively affect salmonine food habits. Consequently, we expect no major changes in salmonine food habits after the dam removal is completed.

J	Ulrich, W; Buszko, J				Ulrich, W; Buszko, J			Species-area relationships of butterflies in Europe and species richness forecasting	ECOGRAPHY			English	Article							COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; ABUNDANCE PATTERNS; SELF-SIMILARITY; DIVERSITY; HABITAT; RANGE; SCALE; BIODIVERSITY; EXTINCTIONS; ENDEMISM	Species-area relationships (SARs) of European butterfly species (Rhopalocera) appear to follow power functions with Mediterranean butterflies having a much higher slope value (z = 0.49) compared to the slope for the northern and eastern European countries (z = 0.10). A simulated process of species extinction by a stepwise density dependent random elimination of species affected species-area patterns differently. For Mediterranean countries SAR slopes decreased, for other European countries slopes increased during the extinction process. Comparisons of species numbers before and after extinction with those predicted by a classical SAR approach differed widely and revealed that SARs are not able to predict future species numbers at local scales. For Mediterranean countries the classical SAR approach underestimated the number of species remaining after simulated extinction, for all other European countries SARs highly overestimated species numbers. These contrasting patterns indicate that changes in SAR patterns do not unequivocally point to changes in species diversity or community structure as assumed by current theory. On the other hand, the results strongly indicate that simplified applications of SARs for forecasting might give misimpressions about species loss and future biodiversity if the initial community structure, especially relative densities and numbers of species with restricted range size, are not taken into account.

However, the persistence of biodiversity can only be ensured through consideration of the ecological and evolutionary processes that underpin biodiversity, as well as its present spatial pattern. This paper identifies spatial surrogates of ecological and evolutionary processes for regional conservation planning in one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, the Cape Floristic Region. We identified six types of spatial components (namely edaphic interfaces, upland-lowland interfaces, sand movement corridors, riverine corridors, upland-lowland gradients and macroclimatic gradients) as surrogates for key processes such as ecological and geographical diversification, and species migration. Spatial components were identified in a GIS using published data and expert knowledge. Options for achieving targets for process components have been seriously compromised by habitat transformation. Between 30 and 75% of the original extent of the spatial components currently remain functional. Options for achieving upland-lowland and macroclimatic gradients are very limited in the lowlands where most of the habitat has been transformed by agriculture. We recommend that future studies place their research on ecological and evolutionary processes in a spatially explicit framework. Areas maintaining adaptive diversification (e.g. environmental gradients, ecotones) or containing historically isolated populations should be identified and protected. The spatial dimensions of eco-logical processes such as drought and fire refugia also need to be determined and such insights incorporated in conservation planning. Finally, connectivity within these areas should be ensured to maintain species migration and gene flow.

The ubiquitous, positive abundance-occupancy relationship is of potential value to conservation and pest management because of the possibility of using it to predict species abundance from occupancy measures. 2. He & Gaston (2000a) developed a model, and a parameterization method, for the prediction of abundance from occupancy based on the negative binomial distribution. There are to date few empirical tests of either the estimation method or model. Here we conduct such a test in a field-based mesocosm experiment using a Drosophilidae assemblage associated with decaying fruit. 3. With individual (and groups of) fruit as minimum mapping units, abundance estimates derived using the parameterization method of the He-Gaston model differed significantly from measured values, and were least accurate for the most abundant species. 4. Substitution of k-values corrected for species density in the model did not improve abundance predictions significantly. However, substitution of k-values calculated directly from the negative binomial distribution yielded highly accurate abundance predictions. 5. Although the distribution of fly species did not deviate significantly from the negative binomial distribution, and the finest possible minimum mapping units were used (individual fruit), the parameterization method in the He-Gaston model consistently underestimated the abundance of species in the assemblage because individuals were very highly aggregated within fruit. 6. Because of its potential importance, this model and parameterization method require further exploration at fine scales, commonly represented by individual habitat units, for highly aggregated species. The incorporation of spatially explicit information may provide a means of improving abundance predictions in this regard.

We examined the effect of distance from roads and its interactions with soil type, aspect, and livestock grazing on native- and exotic-plant diversity in a 130 000-ha inland California (USA) foothill grassland landscape. During spring 2000 and-2001, we measured the numbers of and cover by native and exotic plant species in 92 sites stratified by distance from toads (10 in, 100 in, and > 1000 in), soil type (nonserpentine and serpentine), and aspect (cool, warm, and neutral slopes). In nonserpentine grasslands, native cover was greatest in sites >1000 m-from roads (23%) and least in sites 10 in from roads (0%), and the percentage of species that were native was significantly greatest in sites > 1000 in from roads (44%) and least in those 10 in from roads (32%). In addition, the most distant sites had the largest number of native grass species and the fewest exotic forb species. In serpentine grasslands there was no significant effect of distance from roads on the numbers of and cover by native and exotic species. On both soils, two exotic species (Centaurea solstitialis and Aegilops triuncialis) were at their lowest frequencies, while a native bunchgrass, Nassella pulchra, was at its highest frequency, in sites > 1000 m. from roads. On nonserpentine soils only, the exotics, Convolvulus arvensis and Polypogon monspeliensis, were at their lowest frequency, while a native bunchgrass, Poa secunda, was at its highest frequency in the most distant sites. Native species were more abundant on serpentine than nonserpentine soils; on serpentine, natives were more abundant on slopes than flat sites, while on nonserpentine, natives were least abundant on warm, south-facing slopes. Grazing, soil type, and aspect all, significantly interacted in their effects on native and exotic richness and cover. Grazing negatively affected the number of native grass species, but not the number of native forb species on nonserpentine, and positively affected the number,of native forb species, but not the number of native grass species on serpentine. Roadless areas are significant refuges for native species. However, to protect these habitats from the continued threat of invasion, land managers should consider means of preventing construction of new roads, limiting off-highway vehicle access into grasslands with low road densities, identifying a regime of livestock grazing that favors the persistence of natives over the spread of exotics, and monitoring recreational trails and grazing allotments within roadless areas to detect and eradicate new infestations.

Although this hypothesis was first proposed for marine sponges over 25 years ago, our study provides the first experimental test of latitudinal differences in the effectiveness of sponge chemical defenses. We collected 20 common sponge species belonging to 14 genera from tropical Guam and temperate Northeast Spanish coasts (Indo-Pacific and Mediterranean biogeographic areas) and conducted field-based feeding experiments with large and small fish predators in both geographic areas. We use the term global deterrence to describe the deterrent activity of a sponge extract against all of the predators used in our experiments and to test the hypothesis that sponges from Guam are chemically better defended than their Mediterranean counterparts. Sympatric and allopatric deterrence refer to the average deterrent activity of a sponge against sympatric or allopatric predators. All of the sponges investigated in this study showed deterrent properties against some predators. However, 35% of the sponge species were deterrent in at least one but not in all the experiments, supporting the idea that predators can respond to chemical defenses in a species-specific manner. Tropical and temperate sponges have comparable global, sympatric, and allopatric deterrence, suggesting not only that chemical defenses from tropical and temperate sponges are equally strong but also that they are equally effective against sympatric and allopatric predators. Rather than supporting geographic trends in the production of chemical defenses, our data suggest a recurrent selection for chemical defenses in sponges as a general life-history strategy.

The survey design is based on overlapping and rotating sampling from a given population of sites-in this case 160 sites, each measuring I ha in size.-Estimates of population sizes are obtained using a model-based statistical analysis. Results so far reveal considerable year-tos-year variability in populations of Leadbeater's Possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri), the Mountain Brushtail Possum (Trichosurus cunninghamii), and the Greater Glider (Petauroides volans). There appears to be an initial decline in the numbers of Leadbeater's Possum, an increase in the Mountain Brushtail Possum and no change in the Greater Glider and the total number of arboreal marsupials. It will be possible report more substantive findings about long-term trends after several more years of the program. Relationships between current and past counts for Leadbeater's Possum and Mountain Brushtail Possum were very weak. This result-appeared to be due to low levels of site fidelity for these two species. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Four major aquatic insect orders (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, and Coleoptera, i.e. EPTC), and four environmental variables (elevation, stream order, distance from the source, and water temperature) were used to implement the models. The data were collected and measured at 155 sampling sites on streams of the Adour-Garonne drainage basin (South-western France). The modelling procedure was carried out following two steps. First, a self-organizing map (SOM), an unsupervised ANN, was applied to classify sampling sites using EPTC richness. Second, a backpropagation algorithm (BP),. a supervised ANN, was applied to predict EPTC richness using a set of four environmental variables. The trained SOM classified sampling sites according to a gradient of EPTC richness, and the groups obtained corresponded,to geographic regions of the drainage basin and characteristics of their environmental variables. The SOM showed its convenience to analyze relationships among sampling sites, biological attributes, and environmental variables. After accounting for the relationships in data sets, the BP used to predict the EPTC richness with a, set of four environmental variables, showed a high accuracy (r = 0.91 and r = 0.61 for training and test data sets respectively). The prediction of EPTC richness is thus a valuable tool to. assess disturbances in given areas: by knowing what the EPTC richness should be, we can determine the degree to which disturbances have altered it. The results suggested that methodologies successively using two different neural networks are helpful to understand ecological data through ordination first, and then to predict target variables: (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

While E. athericus traditionally occurs in the high salt marsh, it recently also invaded lower parts of the marsh. In one of the first analyses of the genetic population structure in salt-marsh species, we were interested in population differentiation through isolation-by-distance, and among strongly divergent habitats (low and high marsh) in this wind- and water-dispersed species. High and low marsh habitats were sampled at six sites throughout the Wadden Sea. Based on reciprocal transplantation experiments conducted earlier revealing lower survival of foreign genotypes we predicted reduced gene flow among habitats. Accordingly, an analysis with polymorphic cross-species microsatellite primers revealed significant genetic differentiation between high and low marsh habitats already on a very small scale (<100 m), while isolation-by-distance was present only on larger scales (60-443 km). In an analysis of molecular variance we found that 14% of the genetic variance could be explained by the differentiation between habitats, as compared to only 8.9% to geographical (isolation-by-distance) effects among six sites 2.5-443 km distant from each other. This suggests that markedly different selection regimes between these habitats, in particular intraspecific competition and herbivory, result in habitat adaptation and restricted gene flow over distances as small as 80 m. Hence, the genetic population structure of plant species can only be understood when considering geographical and selection-mediated restrictions to gene flow simultaneously.

J	Huebner, CD; Vankat, JL				Huebner, CD; Vankat, JL			The importance of environment vs. disturbance in the vegetation mosaic of Central Arizona	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE			English	Article						canonical correspondence analysis; chaparral; conversion; fire; grassland; grazing; multi-response permutation; procedure; stability; succession; woodland	GRASSLAND; FIRE; NONEQUILIBRIUM; COMMUNITY; RESPONSES; NITROGEN; DEGRADATION; CONVERSION; PHOSPHORUS; WISCONSIN	The vegetation of central Arizona is a mosaic of four vegetation types: chaparral, chaparral grassland, woodland, and woodland grassland. We analysed ten environmental variables, three disturbance variables, and five disturbance indicators to answer the question: What is the relative importance of environment and disturbance in explaining the vegetation pattern of our study area? We found that chaparral, chaparral grassland, and woodland are differentiated primarily by environmental factors and have high stability in the landscape. In contrast, woodland grassland is differentiated primarily by disturbance and is likely an early-successional stage of woodlands. Although other researchers have indicated that semi-arid vegetation is generally unstable, the vegetation of central Arizona is composed of two systems: those with a more stable landscape position determined primarily by environmental factors and those with a less stable landscape position determined primarily by disturbance factors.

J	Root, KV; Akcakaya, HR; Ginzburg, L				Root, KV; Akcakaya, HR; Ginzburg, L			A multispecies approach to ecological valuation and conservation	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article							STEPHENS KANGAROO-RAT; INFERRING EXTINCTION; DESERT TORTOISE; CALIFORNIA; HABITAT; UNCERTAINTY; POPULATION; RESERVES; MODEL	The conservation of ecosystems focuses on evaluating individual sites or landscapes based on their component species. To produce a map of conservation values, we developed a method to weight habitat-suitability maps for individual species by species-specific extinction risks. The value of a particular site reflects the importance and magnitude of the threats facing the component species of the ecological community. We applied this approach to a set of species from the California Gap Analysis Project. The resulting map of multispecies conservation values identified the areas with the best habitat for the species most vulnerable to extinction. These methods are flexible and can accommodate the quantity and quality of data available for each individual species in both the development of the habitat-suitability maps and the estimation of the extinction risks. Additionally, the multispecies conservation value can accommodate specific conservation goals, such as preservation of local endemics, making it useful for prioritizing conservation and management actions. This approach provides an estimate of the ecological worth of a site based on habitat characteristics and quantitative models in terms of all the ecological components of a site, rather than a single threatened or endangered species.

In this paper, we present a measure of rarity that is less sensitive to the shape and size of a country. We demonstrate that the distribution of species on a national grid is not monofractal. Consequently, rarity figures cannot be scaled down to a finer grid merely using scale-area plots. We propose a downscaling method that takes into account the non-monofractal distribution of species. Rarity figures have often been published on a scale comprising a limited number of rarity classes. This article finally provides an insight into the degree of accuracy of such classes.

J	Barnes, DKA				Barnes, DKA			Local, regional and global patterns of resource use in ecology: hermit crabs and gastropod shells as an example	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						hermit crab; intertidal; resource use; shells; scale; West Indian ocean	DIVERSITY GRADIENTS; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; PAGURUS-LONGICARPUS; QUIRIMBA ISLAND; DECAPODA; ANOMURA; COEXISTENCE; MOZAMBIQUE; SELECTION; PREDATION	To see the 'big pictures', it seems increasingly clear that experimental design, data collection and analyses of ecological investigation need to be at multiple scales. This causes problems with data complexity, sampling (level) and independence. Many ecological programmes are currently conducting multi-scale investigation of organismal trends (e.g. diversity). In this study, by contrast, the assemblages analysed were the resources used by animals (rather than animals per se). Variability in shell use was studied in 5 members of a taxon (hermit crabs) from global to site spatial levels. The novel adaptation of an existing technique used 1-factor, 3-level ANOVA of Bray-Curtis similarity values based on 'centroids' for each scale. Similarity in the number of shells used, the proportional usage of shell types, shell diversity and other variables were examined at site (> 10 m apart), locality (> 1 km apart) and region levels (> 1000 km apart). There was significant variability amongst scales and between regions in shell use of all species. For some species, observed variability differed with location, while in others the trend was similar in all 3 regions. Between 18 and 3 shell types were used by different study species with diversity (Shannon H') values ranging from 2.54 to 0.1 and evenness values from 0.99 to 0.1. Shell use by hermit crabs was less similar (to each other) between regions than between the study hermit crab species. No significant spatial effects at any level were found on the proportion of damaged shells used by different species. The numbers of shell types used by hermit crabs had both a taxon-specific component and a global pattern. Data from the literature in combination with that from the present study showed Dardanus, Diogenes and Pagurus species used fewer shell types than Coenobita, Clibanarius and Calcinus species. No inter-oceanic patterns were evident in any genus. Shell numbers used by Clibanarius and Calcinus species both, however, exhibited distinct latitudinal clines. Adaptation of a novel technique has, thus, demonstrated global (and differential between scale) trends in resource use by a guild of animals, although interpretation of the mechanism or meaning underlying this is not straightforward.

The same soil samples were used to prepare growth medium. Each isolate was then cultured in each medium and its growth recorded. There was no overall tendency for isolates to grow more successfully in their home site (i.e., the medium derived from the soil sample from which they had been extracted). Most isolates grew very poorly, however, and when the analysis was restricted to the minority of vigorous isolates there was clear evidence of local adaptation: isolates tended to grow better at their home site than did isolates from elsewhere and grew better at their home site than they did at other sites. The variation of growth within the 1-ha plot made up a complex fitness landscape of peaks, ridges, and valleys. Most of the vigorous isolates were found at or near a local fitness (growth) peak, although seldom at a global peak. In consequence, there was a tendency for growth to diminish away from the home site. The home isolate was about 50% more fit than average at its home site; fitness diminished exponentially away from the home site at a rate of 0.0577 per meter. These figures are similar to those previously reported for plants. This selection gradient has matched the bacterial assemblage to the edaphic structure of the environment, although the fit is far from perfect.

The complexity and diversity of terrestrial communities has been hypothesized to strongly influence the strength of these top-down and bottom-up forces, and in turn, trophic interactions are predicted to have significant consequences for species diversity within trophic levels. To examine the relative strengths of top-down and bottom-up trophic interactions and their relationship to arthropod diversity in an agricultural ecosystem, we conducted experiments in two alfalfa fields with different management regimes in which we manipulated light availability, nutrients, and arthropod abundance. We employed path analysis to examine how variation generated by these manipulations influenced top-down and bottom-up trophic pathways, focusing on alfalfa productivity and the abundance and species richness of arthropods. These analyses revealed a number of complex interactions between treatments and each of the three trophic levels. Shade structures had a strong effect on enemy, herbivore, and plant trophic levels, but much of the effect on plant biomass appeared to be mediated indirectly through changes in enemy and herbivore abundance. Potential positive effects of nutrient addition on alfalfa biomass were negated due to increases in abundance of soil microbes in the intensively managed field and herbivores in the weedy field. In the intensively managed, low arthropod abundance field, alfalfa biomass increased with herbivore diversity. However, in the lightly managed fields, herbivore diversity, which increased significantly with nutrient addition, reduced alfalfa biomass. The indirect top-down and bottom-up effects uncovered in this experiment were strong, but were not limited to the classic trophic cascades that have been the subject of intense recent investigation.

J	Frappier, B; Eckert, RT; Lee, TD				Frappier, B; Eckert, RT; Lee, TD			Potential impacts of the invasive exotic shrub Rhamnus frangula L. (glossy buckthorn) on forests of southern New Hampshire	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST			English	Article							UNITED-STATES; HISTORY; FLORA	This paper investigated the potential for the exotic shrub Rhamnus frangula L. (glossy buckthorn) to alter native plant community composition in southeastern New Hampshire. Stratified random sampling was performed with 2 m x 2 m plots randomly located in 5 m intervals along three 50 m transects in four even-aged Pinus-mixed hardwood forests, three of which were managed stands. The associations between R. frangula and the measured species abundances and environmental variables were investigated using linear, least-squares multiple regression and Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling Ordination. Plot basal area of R. frangula was inversely related to woody seedling density (p < 0.001), herb cover (p < 0.05), and species richness (p < 0.01). The relative contribution of R. frangula to explaining variance in seedling density was greater than canopy openness, soil pH, soil clay, or soil sand. Abundance of R. frangula was a statistically significant predictor (p < 0.05) of individual herb species abundances for all study sites. This evidence supports the hypothesis that R. frangula causes a decline in seedling density and alters native ground level plant species abundances. Furthermore, the patterns agree with the suppression of ground level plant species abundances by R. frangula found in removal experiments.

Rhizoprionodon terraenovae consumed the highest diversity of prey items, which included teleost fishes (67.0%), crustaceans (37.0%), mollusks (8.0%) and elasmobranchs (2.5%). Carcharhinus limbatus and C. isodon fed primarily on teleost fishes, which occurred in 94 % and 100 %, respectively, of stomachs that contained prey. All shark species exhibited a medium to high level of dietary overlap, with the highest level of overlap found between C. limbatus and C. isodon. An ontogenetic shift was observed in the dietary habits of R. terraenovae with young sharks feeding primarily on invertebrate prey (65.2%), and adult sharks feeding primarily on teleosts (69.0%) and elasmobranchs (5.8%).

The objective of this study was to quantify the influence of habitat type on the activity and distribution of ground beetles. Over five years, 13,654 ground beetles representing 107 different species were captured. Of these, 14 species represented 85 % of the captured beetles. Based on habitat use, we categorized 24 as generalist species, 14 as agricultural species, 12 as grassland species, 39 as prairie specialists, and 19 as woodland species. Tallgrass prairie hosted a significantly more (P < 0.05) diverse assemblage of ground beetles than was found in the other habitats. Prairie also had a higher percentage of habitat specialists in its assemblage than did the less stable agricultural habitats which were dominated by generalists. NMS ordination and indicator species analysis revealed distinct ground beetle assemblages and identified indicator species in the various habitats, allowing species assemblages to be used as habitat indicators.

Aphids are interesting in this regard, as they have the potential for unusually high levels of dispersal and natural selection, which typically counter each other. In the present study, winged grain aphids Sitobion avenae (F.) were collected in four 12.2-m high suction traps along a north-south transect in Britain in order to eliminate sampling bias from plant hosts (cereals and grasses; Poaceae), it being known that these insects show host adaptation demonstrable using molecular markers. Samples were analysed at four polymorphic microsatellite loci over two consecutive years. Population allele frequencies were similar nationally during the two years, although clonal diversity varied greatly between sites and years. In the first sampling year following a harsh winter, diversity was found to display a latitudinal clinal trend: the proportion of unique clones (genotypes) increased with latitude. However, this pattern was less apparent the following year, after a milder winter. Nonetheless, overall F-ST analysis showed that there was little spatial genetic structuring in either sampling year. These data support the view that the insect is highly migratory and also support a theoretical model and previous data suggesting that the reproductive mode is clinal in S. avenae. This appears to be because natural selection (reduced reproductive success of asexual genotypes under cold conditions) is sufficiently powerful to overcome the homogenizing effects of strong migration. There was no clear evidence for isolation by distance for the genetic data obtained. The data are compared with similar data from other aphid species and other insects. Only by the collection of such data sets can an accurate picture be built up relating genetic variability to flight behaviour, including migratory ambit in this group of insects since, due to their small size and rapid dilution in the air, other marking approaches are impracticable over large geographical distances.

Agriculture locations had significantly higher landscape diversity, more patches, smaller mean patch sizes, and more complex patch shapes than forest locations. Mosquito collections were undertaken during both dry and wet seasons from October 1997 to December 1999. The density of two forest-associated species, Anopheles maculatus s.s. and Anopheles minimus s.l., both primary malaria vectors in Thailand, was significantly higher in forest locations in at least one season. The density of two paddy field-associated species, Anopheles aconitus and Anopheles hyrcanus group did not differ between locations. Anopheles aconitus is a secondary malaria vector and An. hyrcanus group is not considered as a vector in Thailand. The density of An. minimus s.l. was positively related to forest mean patch size, various water and paddy field landscape metrics and negatively related to landscape diversity. Anopheles hyrcanus group was also positively related to water metrics. Anopheline species diversity was negatively related to landscape diversity. Forest fragmentation resulting from human economic activities often increases landscape heterogeneity, which may result in a reduction in anopheline species diversity, as was the case in this study. There are indications that the effect of fruit orchards on anopheline diversity might be different in the dry season compared to the wet season. Fruit orchard landscape metrics affected species diversity negatively in the dry season and positively in the wet season. One reason for this could be that pesticides are typically applied in fruit orchards during the dry season. The conversion of forests to fruit orchards is a major land-use change in northern Thailand. These results show the complexity of vector status in northern Thailand and that vector and agriculture pest control are intricately interrelated. It is therefore important to include both the public health and agricultural sectors in controlling malaria vectors in the country. Our results also indicate that if landscape management should be used for malaria control in northern Thailand large-scale reduction and fragmentation of forest cover would be needed. Such drastic actions do not agree well with current global objectives concerning forest and biodiversity conservation.

We estimated the disturbance rate ( mound building activity) by Mediterranean voles, their effects on vegetation and the mechanisms of these effects during a period of vole outbreak. The effects on vegetation were analysed at the levels of species, functional groups and plant community. Disturbance rate was high and voles can disturb the entire soil surface once every four or five years. The availability of certain trophic resources ( perennial plants) appeared to drive vole expansion in the experimental plots and it was independent of the irrigation and grazing treatments. Mound building activities largely affected vegetation but conserved plot differences. Total vegetation cover, absolute cover of all functional groups, mean vegetation height and species richness were less on mounds than on undisturbed ground. These effects did not change the relative abundance of annuals, perennials, grasses and forbs. Only the relative abundance of small-seeded species decreased on mounds. As the proportion of these seeds was similar in both types of patches, we suggest that small-seeded species had more difficulties for germinating or emerging when they are buried during mound formation. Irrigation and sheep grazing promoted large changes in the vegetation parameters but these effects were, in general, similar on mounds and undisturbed ground. Our results show that the availability of germinable seeds may be the major limitation for mound revegetation, probably due to the scarcity of seeds existing at the depths from which soils are excavated. Our results also suggested a resource limitation on mounds. The results provide additional evidence that soil disturbances by small herbivore mammals exert relevant ecological effects on abandoned Mediterranean croplands. We discuss the ecological implications of vole mound-building activities for plant succession, plant species conservation and forage resource availability for livestock.

A discriminant analysis showed that it was possible to distinguish each fish species according to the egg and larval AA. Moreover, egg and larval AA varied among different areas within each fish species. From the data of larval abundance obtained from 5 cruises carried out along the northern Spanish coast from 1995 to 2000 (Mph-1995, Sefos-1995, Careva-1998, Jureva-1998 and Seamar-2000), the temporal and spatial overlap among fish species was estimated. There was a significant relationship between larval AA similarity and larval spatial-temporal overlap among fish species, which means that those larval species that had greater spatial and temporal overlap, had a similar larval AA. On this basis, the differences in egg and larval AA within each fish species among different areas seem to be due to differences in habitat conditions; mainly temperature, salinity, and food quality and quantity. We concluded that egg and larval AA could be used as indicators of niche resource partitioning (food resources and spatial allocation) among pelagic fish species.

Developing countries are trying to counter act this massive lost of biodiversity by implementing national parks and biological reserves. Costa Rica is no exception to this rule. National development strategies in Costa Rica, since the early 1970s, have involved the creation of several National Parks and Biological Reserves. This has led to monitoring the integrity of and interactions between these protected areas. Key questions include: "Are these areas' boundaries respected?"; "Do they create a functioning network?"; and "Are they effective conservation tools?". This paper quantifies deforestation and secondary growth trends within and around protected areas between 1960 and 1997. We find that inside of national parks and biological reserves, deforestation rates were negligible. For areas outside of National Parks and Biological reserves we report that for 1-km buffer zones around such protected areas. there is a net forest gain for the 1987/1997 time period. Thus, it appears that to this point the boundaries of protected areas are respected. However. in the 10-km buffer zones we find significant forest loss for all study periods, This suggests that increasing isolation of protected areas may prevent them from functioning as an effective network.

A review of the methods used to measure success. in previous restoration efforts indicated the potential value of multimetric methods to make the comparison. We designed a new method that retains some of the advantages of multimetric methods but also removes some of the associated problems. The new method was applied to data from 30 restored sites (phosphate-mined land) and 30 reference sites in central Florida (USA), and it showed the difference in wildlife composition between restored and reference sites to be large, relative to the maximum possible difference. Alternative methods were applied to the same data. Multivariate methods were unable to measure success adequately. Percentage similarity analysis yielded results seemingly comparable to those derived with the new method, but the new method possesses advantages over percentage similarity analysis. The advantages derive largely from the first step of the new method, which is ranking species according to the magnitude of the difference between distributions at restored and reference sites. Species ranking clearly reveals which species contribute most to the distance between the restored system and the target; enables well-founded decision-making about, which species,can be excluded, if necessary, without seriously compromising the restoration goal; promotes rigor in the subsequent steps of the model; and overcomes the problem that a single species may inordinately influence the result.

J	Nee, S; Cotgreave, P				Nee, S; Cotgreave, P			Does the species/area relationship account for the density/area relationship?	OIKOS			English	Article							MAMMALIAN CARNIVORES; BODY-SIZE; POPULATION-DENSITY; BIRD COMMUNITIES; AREA; ABUNDANCE; TERRESTRIAL; OCCUPANCY; PATTERNS; ISLAND	The best-known macroecological generalisation is the species/area relationship: larger areas contain more species. It has also been observed that the estimated densities of individual species is lower when they are censused over a larger area. Let us call this the density/area relationship. Numerous explanations for the density/area relationship have been proposed - including the idea that the relationship is artefactual. One possible explanation is that it is a necessary consequence of the species/area relationship - after all, if a larger area is to contain more species then the average abundance of individual species must decline. We study a data set that allows us to study both relationships simultaneously. We conclude that the density/area relationship observed for the individual species in this study is consistent with the species/area relationship explanation: in other words, the densities of individual species decline, quantitatively, in the manner required to fit more species into communities with larger areas. We conclude that whatever explains the species/area relationship also explains the density/area relationship and discuss, in particular, the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis.

J	Stokke, S; du Toit, JT				Stokke, S; du Toit, JT			Sexual segregation in habitat use by elephants in Chobe National Park, Botswana	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Africa elephant; Chobe; habitat; sexual segregation	NORTHERN NAMIB DESERT; DEER CERVUS-ELAPHUS; AFRICAN ELEPHANT; SIZE DIMORPHISM; BODY-SIZE; INDIRECT COMPETITION; LOXODONTA-AFRICANA; HERBIVORES; CHOICE; METABOLISM	We report on a study conducted on free-ranging Africa elephants in the woodlands of northern Botswana. We compared bull groups and family units with regard to (1) their patterns of habitat use and (2) their ranging distances from perennial water sources. During the dry season, adult males frequented more habitat types than family units, whereas family units used a wider diversity of habitats than bulls during the wet season. Bulls roamed widely (>10 km) from perennial drinking water in the dry season, when family units congregated within 3.5 km of the rivers. During the wet season, when ephemeral pans were abundant, all elephant groups were found at intermediate distances (5 km) from the rivers. The spacing of elephants in the dry season is consistent with sexual segregation but we reject the hypothesis that this is a outcome of indirect competition for food, because our concurrent studies on elephant feeding ecology found no evidence for intraspecific competition. Instead, we propose that most adult male elephants space themselves to avoid conflict with musth bulls and roam widely in the dry season between discretely distributed feeding 'hotspots'. The small proportion of males that are in musth remain close to family units to maximize mating opportunities, and family units are unable to range far from water in the dry season. This is due to (1) comparatively high rates of water turn-over among juveniles and lactating cows and (2) the reduced mobility of neonates.

J	Tew, KS; Han, CC; Chou, WR; Fang, LS				Tew, KS; Han, CC; Chou, WR; Fang, LS			Habitat and fish fauna structure in a subtropical mountain stream in Taiwan before and after a catastrophic typhoon	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES			English	Article						fish population; habitat alteration; disturbance; typhoon Herb	ENDEMIC CYPRINID; BIOLOGY; FLOODS	Habitats and fish populations of a subtropical mountain stream in Taiwan were surveyed before and after the hit of super-typhoon Herb in July 1996. There was a significant decrease in total pool area and an increase in total riffle area. Upper stream habitat was more susceptible to the disturbance. Relative abundance of the species was significantly correlated before and after the typhoon (rs = 0.89, p < 0.001). Morisita's index of similarity for the fish communities in June 1996 and October 1997 ranged between 0.82 and 1.02 for seven out of nine stations. Most common cyprinids decreased in densities after Herb, but recovered seventeen months after the typhoon. There were only minor changes in fish community fourteen months after the typhoon. Cyprinids that are smaller in size, such as Candidia barbata and Abottina brevirostris alticorpus were affected the most. Gobiid Rhinogobius nantaiensis that is well adapted to riffle habitat was unaffected throughout the surveys. The results of this study suggested that in subtropical mountain stream, severe typhoon may significantly alter the habitats, but the impact on fish populations could be relatively small due to features of these mountain species.

J	Wolter, BHK; Fonda, RW				Wolter, BHK; Fonda, RW			Gradient analysis of vegetation on the north wall of the Columbia River Gorge, Washington	NORTHWEST SCIENCE			English	Article							CASCADE MOUNTAINS; OREGON; FORESTS; DIVERSITY; LANDSCAPE; PATTERN	The Columbia River Gorge represents an ecocline of shifting environmental factors, species populations, and vegetation associations. Combinations of wind, temperature, and precipitation create different environmental regimes from the west to the east. The north wall of the Gorge supported four physiognomic associations: western conifer forest, central mixed forest, central broadleaf forest, and eastern steppe. Each association comprised species distributed individually along the ecocline. Douglas-fir, western redcedar, bigleaf maple, dull Oregongrape, sword fern, bracken, vine maple, and red bilberry were centered in the western conifer forest. Garry oak, ponderosa pine, poison oak, and snowberry were centered in the central mixed forest. Cheatgrass, northern buckwheat, Wyeth's lupine, western serviceberry, mockorange, and Sandberg's bluegrass were centered in the eastern steppe. Although the center of distribution for each species was in one of the associations, few were confined to a specific association. The Columbia River Gorge is analogous to a mountain turned on its side, with the cool, moist summit to the west and the warm, dry base to the east. Plant species have migrated both eastward and westward along this ecocline during the lifetime of the Gorge, and each association has combinations of species derived from surrounding regions in Washington and Oregon.

(Ranunculaceae) inferred from amplified fragment length polymorphism markers	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						amplified fragment length polymorphism markers (AFLP); genetic variation; habitat fragmentation; population differentiation; postglacial recolonization; sympatric speciation; Trollius europaeus	POLLINATORS CHIASTOCHETA FLIES; SEED-PARASITIC POLLINATORS; SPRUCE PICEA-ABIES; POSTGLACIAL RECOLONIZATION; POPULATION-SIZE; DIVERSITY; PLANT; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; SPECIATION; EVOLUTION	The distribution of genetic variation and the phylogenetic relationships between 18 populations of the arctic-alpine plant Trollius europaeus were analysed in three main regions (Alps, Pyrenees and Fennoscandia) by using dominant AFLP markers. Analysis of molecular variance revealed that most of the genetic variability was found within populations (64%), although variation among regions (17%) and among populations within regions (19%) was highly significant (P < 0.001). Accordingly, the global fixation index F-ST averaged over loci was high (0.39). The among-population differentiation indicates restricted gene flow, congruent with limited dispersal of specific globeflower's pollinating flies (Chiastocheta spp.). Within-population diversity levels were significantly higher in the Alps (mean Nei's expected heterozygosity H-E = 0.229) than in the Pyrenees (H-E = 0.197) or in Fennoscandia (H-E = 0.158). This finding is congruent with the species-richness of the associated flies, which is maximum in the Alps. We discuss the processes involved in shaping observed patterns of genetic diversity within and among T. europaeus populations. Genetic drift is the major factor acting on the small Pyrenean populations at the southern edge of T. europaeus distribution, while large Fennoscandian populations result probably from a founder effect followed by demographic expansion. The Alpine populations represent moderately fragmented relics of large southern ancestral populations. The patterns of genetic variability observed in the host plant support the hypothesis of sympatric speciation in associated flies, rather than recurrent allopatric speciations.

J	Heikkinen, RK				Heikkinen, RK			Complementarity and other key criteria in the conservation of herb-rich forests in Finland	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						complementarity; edge effects; reserve selection criteria; site-selection algorithms; species-based methods; vascular plants; viability	RESERVE SELECTION PROCEDURES; TEMPORAL SPECIES TURNOVER; VASCULAR PLANTS; BOREAL FORESTS; BREEDING BIRDS; WESTERN NORWAY; BIODIVERSITY; AREAS; DIVERSITY; NETWORKS	Complementarity of the nature reserve network in southernmost Finland was examined using a simple heuristic algorithm and occurrence data of 75 characteristic herb-rich forest vascular plant species in 126 protected and 120 non-protected sites. Three different minimum sets were selected to represent 1, 5, or 10 occurrences of each species. In each minimum set there were significantly more protected than non-protected sites. Thus, although efficiency is not maximal in the existing reserve network, the network does provide a representative basis for the conservation of herb-rich forest plants. However, some deficiencies were also noticed, particularly new reserves in floristically diverse herb-rich forests along watercourses would supplement the existing reserve network. On the other hand, the growing concern over the shortcomings of reserve selection studies using presence / absence data is echoed here, because many of the protected forests not included in the minimum sets harbour important nature conservation values. With regard to the five biological reserve selection criteria (e. g. occurrences of threatened species) considered here, the performance of the existing reserve network is rather good. However, examination of five reserve design criteria revealed some deficiencies, particularly vulnerability of many reserves to potential edge effects.

J	Brand, RH				Brand, RH			The effect of prescribed burning on epigeic springtails (Insecta : Collembola) of woodland litter	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST			English	Article							TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; DECOMPOSITION; FOREST; SOIL; POPULATIONS; ARTHROPODS; MICROARTHROPODS; MINERALIZATION; ABUNDANCE	Species richness, frequency and density of litter-dwelling springtails (Collembola) were analyzed from woodland litter samples collected for 4 y, over a 12 y interval, from The East Woods of The Morton Arboretum, Lisle, Illinois. The 162 samples were divided equally between areas that had been previously burned and areas that had not been burned. There were significantly fewer springtail species in burned areas and 8 of the 10 most common species had lower frequencies in burned areas. The effect of fire varied for the 30 species identified in the study. Isotoma notabilis, Lepidocyrtus spp., Neanura muscorum and Tomocerus flavescens had a significantly higher frequency and density in unburned areas and Isotoma viridis and Xenylla grisea had a significantly higher frequency and density in burned areas. The mean dry weight of litter from 126 samples (equal number from burned and unburned areas) over 3 y was significantly heavier from the unburned areas. To maintain the richness of the litter invertebrates of forest ecosystems where prescribed burning is used, it is proposed that the scheduling of annual fires be changed to every 2 or 3 y. Before the use of fire, scattered refuge areas should also be established and maintained to enhance invertebrate survival.

In a case study, we assessed the ecological and socioeconomic condition of the El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve (EVBR) in Baja California, Mexico, and critiqued its design and management. Although there have been successes in scientific research and conservation of species of concern at EVBR, the current management approach, largely focused on single species, is inadequate to meet both regional biodiversity conservation goals and socioeconomic needs of local peoples. We discuss factors that have hindered the conservation and socioeconomic development of EVBR and suggest changes in management that can improve its function as a biosphere reserve.

J	Harris, RB; Pletscher, DH				Harris, RB; Pletscher, DH			Incentives toward conservation of argaii Ovis ammon: a case study of trophy hunting in western China	ORYX			English	Article						Aksai County; argali; China; conservation incentives; Ovis aninion; trophy hunting		We investigated management of wildlife, habitat and the hunting programme in Aksai County, Gansu Province, People's Republic of China, during 1997-2000. Argali Ovis amnion is the focal species both for conservation and hunting. The hunting programme is intended to produce incentives to conserve wildlife and habitat. Poaching, a serious concern throughout western China, has been reduced in recent years in Aksai. Wildlife population trends are unknown because standardized surveys were begun only in 2000. Threats to argali in Aksai include livestock grazing, placer gold mining, and development of a dam, reservoir and aqueduct. The number of hunters participating in the programme (c. 3 per year) could provide considerable funding (c. $60,000 per year), but the allocation of these funds within China has provided too little for conservation at the local level, thus undermining the intended incentive system. Because local wildlife protection officials have been denied both funding and authority to deal with threats to the wildlife, the programme's contribution to conservation has been minor. We recommend that hunters pay fees directly to county-level staff, thus increasing the proportion of funds retained at county-level, and that this added income is used to obtain wildlife grazing rights on important seasonal habitats for argali. These changes would promote local wildlife conservation without the need for additional external funding.

J	Pauchard, A; Villarroel, P				Pauchard, A; Villarroel, P			Protected areas in Chile: History, current status, and challenges	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL			English	Article						biodiversity conservation; Chile; ecotourism; private reserves; protected areas system	CONSERVATION TARGETS; ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS; BIODIVERSITY; LANDSCAPES; ARGENTINA; MAMMALS; RESERVE; FOREST; SCALE; PARK	Natural reserves or protected areas are a keystone of global strategies for biological conservation. With over 18% of its land under protection, Chile faces challenges similar to those in other developing countries. In this paper we describe the history and status of protected areas in Chile, and identify the challenges that the country confronts for improving the conservation and social efficacy of protected areas. Following the modem "pristine" concept of protected areas, Chile created its first protected area in 1907 and the first national park in 1925. Historically, several national and local agencies were in charge of the creation and management of protected areas. In 1984, the national public system of protected areas was created to organize the scattered protected areas around a unified system that seeks to conserve Chilean natural resources. The system has several problems that jeopardize its capability to conserve Chilean biodiversity: insufficient ecosystem representation, inadequate coverage of biodiversity hot-spots, low budgets, and boundary issues. Private protected areas have recently been considered as complementary units to SNASPE. But there are questions about long-term commitment and restriction to development in such areas. The growth of ecotourism may be boosting SNASPE and private reserve initiatives, but it may also threaten the conservation of pristine environments. We propose that protected areas in Chile be part of a comprehensive conservation policy that considers the entire range of natural resources. This policy should also address new ways to conserve biodiversity outside protected area boundaries, bringing both private and public initiatives together.

However, the species' range has not expanded and the population is increasingly under threat from habitat loss due to built development. The UK Biodiversity Action Plan calls for re-establishment of populations outside the current range in order to ensure a wider geographical spread of this species. This study examined territory distribution and foraging patterns of cirl buntings in relation to habitat variables in order to inform the process of site protection and site selection for a possible translocation programme. Cirl bunting territories were positively associated with rough grassland, non-linear scrub and habitat richness, and intensive permanent pasture was avoided. Resampling methods showed that rough grassland was used significantly more than improved pasture as a foraging habitat and that both rough grass and cereals were used more than other arable crops. The results emphasise the importance of protection of unimproved pastures in 'green field' sites and will help quantify the potential carrying capacity of candidate `receptor' sites.
